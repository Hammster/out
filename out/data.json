I can't remember the last time I was outside.\\n\\nDay One\\nWe've arrived in Deradune. It's not exactly what I was expectin' - a little on the barren side, but it'll do for now. And here I was hopin' for some trees!\\n\\nScuttlebutt is, the hornheads got a village nearby. That oughta make things... interesting. \\n\\nDay One - Later\\nOf all the rotten luck! Command's assigned me to the mines. You know... minin'. A bot could do my job better, but we're short on bots. Guess I'll have to make the best of it.\\n\\nI spend years aboard ship, get stationed on Nexus, and then I end up workin' underground. Who did I tick off, I wonder? \\n\\nDay Two\\nWe're minin' accelerite. I guess it's valuable or somethin'. One of the mercs told me it speeds folks up. He said he knew a guy who knew a guy who inhaled a bunch of accelerite dust. It made him fast - real fast - but it also aged him ten years in about two minutes.\\n\\nI'm not sure if it's true, or if he was just tryin' to scare me, but I'm wearin' my breath mask... just in case.\\n\\nDay Four\\n I just saw Arkos down here. That guy's one tough hombre! He's been fightin' the Draken his whole life, practically. Just havin' him around makes me feel better.\\n\\nDay Five\\nThere's trouble with the transport's drive system. Hopefully, the mechanic can get it up and runnin' soon so we can get some of this ore back to the fleet. \\n\\nMakin' matters worse, the Draken know we're here. One of the guards saw one of 'em sneakin' around, probably a scout. That puts us in somethin' of a bad spot.\\n\\nAh, well. Back to work. This accelerite ain't gonna mine itself.",

    "content": "In the wake of the discovery of Nexus, the Dominion spymaster Axis Pheydra of the Imperial Corps of Intelligence found herself in need of an operative to serve as her eyes and ears in the field. Wary of treachery from within, Pheydra decided to create her own Mechari super-agent. She called this project the Lethality Efficiency eXperiment and named her lethal creation \"Lex.\"\\n\\nUnder Pheydra's watchful eye, Lex trained rigorously in the arts of reconnaissance, assassination, tactical deployment, and  espionage. On the day he was to complete his training, Axis Pheydra called Lex into her quarters.\\n\\n\"You have exceeded my expectations, Lex. You have demonstrated superiority in every aspect of your training - a testament to your creator's brilliance.\"\\n\\n\"As that was you, I feel obligated to agree.\" \\n\\n\"Your intelligence continues to impress me as well. For your final test, I want you to undertake a very special assassination.\"\\n\\n\"I look forward to the challenge. Who is the target?\"\\n\\n\"Emperor  Myrcalus, supreme ruler of the Dominion.\"\\n\\nFor a moment, Lex thought his audio receptors had malfunctioned. Assassinate the emperor? The emperor was one of the Luminai, descended from the Eldan themselves! But agents of the ICI did not question orders. If Axis Pheydra desired the death of Emperor Myrcalus, he would deliver.\\n\\nThat very night, Lex infiltrated the emperor's palace. Overcoming the ferocious and bloodthirsty Draken throneguards would draw too  much attention, so stealth, misdirection, and tactical elimination would have to serve instead.\\n\\nAfter swiftly mapping the area and studying the patrol patterns of the guards, Lex deployed disorientation generators in strategic locations. Blinded and confused, the Draken guards slashed wildly at one another, allowing Lex to slip past the patrols and into the emperor's private chambers. \\n\\nHis target stood unsuspecting in the center of the room, seemingly unaware of his approaching death. Without hesitation, Lex unsheathed his neurotoxin blades and leapt at Emperor Myrcalus. But just as the Mechari agent brought his weapons down for the killing blow, the emperor moved with inhuman speed, catching his arm just before the strike found its mark. \\n\\n\"You have done well,\" she said. \"Welcome to the ICI.\" With casual grace, she handed him an unmarked gray wafer.\\n\\n\"A hologuise unit,\" he said, examining it briefly.\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" she said. \"You will need it. There are additional targets that... require your attention.\"\\n\\nLex listened carefully as she named them one by one. The list, he noted, was extensive.",

Yet despite our best efforts - nay, despite even our extraordinary successes! - we have been caught like vermin in a trap.\\n\\nIn our hubris, we have only traded one form of captivity for another.\\n\\n\\nI believe our time in transit will be short. To consider other alternatives is to walk the razor's edge of insanity.  The crew is frightened - who can blame them? And yet...\\n\\nMy original calculations revealed the journey would be instantaneous. As we have yet to emerge from the void, I can only surmise that my calculations were incorrect.\\n\\nIt occurs to me now that perhaps time in the void does not pass in a manner similar to time in native space. If this is the case, there must be some conversion rate that will reveal how long our trip will last.\\n\\n\\nNine months! Damn the unknown! Damn my naiveté!\\n\\n Anything longer than three months is a death sentence, as our Vitalus supply was not intended to last more than a week or two. Though we have a full laboratory available aboard the Shade, we haven't the raw materials to create the serum we will need.\\n\\nI will not give up. I will find a way to survive.\\n\\n\\nSacrifices must be made. Some of us will die... it is inevitable. Yet they should die so others can live. I take no pleasure in my butcher's task, but I am comforted by the knowledge that history  will absolve me.\\n\\n\\nThe ravenous are useless to me, as are the dead. Only those who still have some vestige of Vitalus in their systems can provide the essence I need to extend my viability.\\n\\nI had thought to allow Bolav to join me, for I might have enough for the two of us... but no. He has grown soft and weak, shackled by his own conscience. I can see he plots against me, even though he maintains a facade of loyalty so perfect that it almost pains me to betray him in kind.\\n\\nIf I am the only one  to survive, then so be it. Many have died so that I might live to remember them.\\n\\n\\nMy transformation will be a long, slow process. Fueled by the essence of my comrades and strengthened by the unknowable energies of the void, I will ascend beyond the frailties inflicted upon me by the Contagion.\\n\\nNine months will pass in the blink of an eye. I will give this painful gift to my people on Nexus, and they will kneel before me in gratitude. Such is my just reward for the sacrifices I have made.\\n\\n\\n Bolav has outwitted me. His containment procedures have guaranteed that I remain on the Shade's bridge until such time as I can engineer my freedom. Ignorant of the timetable I have discovered, he took his own life before the last of his Vitalus could be spent. The poor fool.\\n\\nI am given the benefit of time, for I can last many months here amidst the dead and the damned. So I will wait, and I will watch, and in time... I will be free."

    "content": "Surveyor's Log, Asteroid DU23, Anten Tynes reporting.\\n\\nEntry 1, Initial Report\\nAnalysis of DU23 samples reveals significant amounts of magnesium, titanium, cobalt, and tungsten. Not insignificant amounts of gold and lead. Small amounts of uranium, too. Looks like a figurative gold mine. I'll put the computer to work at once, and get the bots up and mining.\\n\\nEntry 2\\nIn speaking with the computer, I've noticed some strange behavior. It calls itself \"Axiom\" now, whatever that means. I've never seen a  computer do that before. Once we clean DU23 out, we should probably have the thing reformatted. It gives me the creeps.\\n\\nEntry 3\\nThe others and I have everything set up on DU23. We're going to do a survey of some other potential mines, but we'll be back. By that time, everything should be well under way here.\\n\\nEntry 4\\nAfter twenty-nine days mapping other claims, we're back on DU23. The computer's been busy, and the mining units are working at top capacity.\\n\\nThe computer still refers to  itself as Axiom. It feels like we're being watched everywhere we go. It's disconcerting. I'm not going to wait until the job is done to reformat the system, I'm going to go ahead and do it tonight or tomorrow.\\n\\nEntry 5\\nAxiom, whatever it is, has taken control of the facility here. I tried to use the command override, but it didn't work. After that, things started getting bad. We tried to get to the landing pad so we could get off this rock, but the minebots kept us back.\\n\\nOf the four of us, we've  got one dead and two wounded. A minebot hit me pretty hard, but it's only a cracked rib or two. I think I'll be okay if we can get out of here.\\n\\nAs it is, we've retreated into the mines, our backs to a wall. We've got a couple of weapons, but nothing heavy. Once we've had some rest, we're going to try and get back to the landing pad.\\n\\nEntry 6\\nAxiom scuttled our ship! The only thing left to do is get  into the control center and smash his terminal to pieces. That's the one thing we need to do.\\n\\nI'm going to hide this report. If it's found and this is the last entry, you can assume the worst. Otherwise, I'll be handing it over to top management when we get back home.\\n\\nAnten Tynes, Chief Surveyor, out.",

    "content": "One boat's sunk; the other is out of fuel. There's nothing left for it. The six of us who remain will have to eke out some kind of living here on this forsaken island. Just in case we don't, though, I wanted to get some of this information down. If you find this log, it's more than likely we're all dead - or, at the least, I am.\\n\\nMy name is Alain Grumby. I was captain of this ship, which I christened as the Sprat all those years ago. Though, to be honest, ship is probably too grand a word for the  Sprat. It's really more of a boat, after all. She and her twin, the Guppy, weren't designed for such long voyages over such rough seas.\\n\\nMy first mate, Gil, was my constant companion up until his death. We came to this planet purely by accident, but we didn't come alone. Part of me blames Gil for the predicament we're in - he thought the money we'd be paid was worth it, after all - but the blame is only partly his. Should you seek to prosecute anyone, you should first look to Lord Baccus.\\n\\nLord Baccus , our financier, has been the driving force behind this expedition. He and his wife, Natalia, have treated it like a vacation ever since we plotted our initial course and puttered out to sea. Baccus is very rich, you see, and he pays us very well. It was by his insistence we came here, low on fuel and food and other supplies. He also sent Gil inland to explore, where he met a very messy end.\\n\\nThe other members of the expedition - also employees or associates of Baccus - included Lady Jinnevar, an  entertainer and a family friend of Baccus, as well as Professor Hispallus, a renowned doctor and scientist, and his assistant, Marina. Aside from Marina, who proved to be quite robust, the rest of Baccus's crew was largely useless in anything resembling a dire situation.\\n\\nAs far as our current predicament is concerned, we are stranded here on this foggy island in the middle of an alien ocean. The creatures that live here are, by and large, ferocious. From huge, acid-spewing snails to a breed of  hulking predator that attacks and kills like a sudden whirlwind, there is little here that one might consider friendly.\\n\\nWith Gil dead, Baccus has decided that we should head inland. He feels our salvation is hidden there. Given the presence of the creatures that killed my first mate, I doubt we'll get very far. But we have to try, I guess. Staying here isn't an option.\\n\\nAnd that, in brief, is my tale. Sad and sordid, perhaps, but it belongs to me. It is my legacy. And should I die,  at least I will not suffer the further indignities of following Lord Baccus's every whim.\\n\\nSkipper Alain Grumby",

It's a pleasure to have you here.\\n\\nArtemis Zin: Please, call me Artemis.\\n\\nMA: As you wish, Artemis. Tell me, is there any truth to the rumors that you will be leaving Cassus soon on yet another expedition?\\n\\nAZ: Oh, yes. I'm quite excited about it, though I can't reveal too much for security reasons.  I'm sure you understand.\\n\\nMA: Completely, my lady. What can you tell my readers about this impending journey?\\n\\nAZ: As part of a Dominion expedition to an as-of-yet unexplored world, I intend to discover the secrets of the Elder Cube.\\n\\nMA: I was under the impression that the Elder Cube was a myth. Can you explain?\\n\\nAZ: I assure you, Marcus, the Elder Cube is quite real.\\n\\nMA: What is your interest in the Elder Cube, if I might ask?\\n\\nAZ: That's difficult to quantify. The Elder Cube  is the key to all things, you see. It is the embodiment of the depth and breadth of Eldan knowledge. So, in effect, my interest in the Elder Cube is an interest in learning the secrets of the entire universe.\\n\\nMA: How ambitious!\\n\\nAZ: You wouldn't be the first to say so! (She laughs merrily.)\\n\\nMA: Will Kevo be traveling with you?\\n\\nAZ: Of course. I make it a point not to go anywhere without my faithful Kevo. Isn't that right?\\n\\nKevo: Yes, my lady.\\n\\nMA: When will you be leaving?\\n\\nAZ:  I can't really say.\\n\\nMA: My readers have sent in a number of questions. Might I ask you one that has, frankly, been on my mind since you arrived?\\n\\nAZ: Oh, certainly.\\n\\nMA: Allow me to paraphrase. \"Dear Lady Zin, is there a special someone in your life? Signed, Brianna S.\"\\n\\nAZ: Not at the moment, no. My work keeps me busy, and I'm rarely on Cassus for more than a few weeks at a time. Love is a luxury I have little time for, I'm afraid.\\n\\nMA: So I have a chance, then? \\n\\nAZ: Oh, Marcus! You're incorrigible.\\n\\nMA: Our next question. \"Artemis, how did you meet your Draken guardian, Kevo? Signed, Meridius.\"\\n\\nAZ: Kevo has long been a member of my household. He has always been there for me, as far back as I can remember, and I owe my life to him several times over. He is the embodiment of Draken strength, ferocity, and dependability.\\n\\nMA: From the looks of Kevo, it appears as if my time with  you is up.\\n\\nAZ: I'm afraid so. I can't say how much I've enjoyed this, Marcus.\\n\\nMA: The pleasure was all mine, Lady Zin.",

If I hadn't been a child at the time I'm not sure I could have stood the shock and horror, but when you're a child, you don't think about what's right and what's wrong. What's supposed  to never, ever happen suddenly does, and you see it right before your eyes.\\n\\nNo one tells a child that your mother isn't supposed to kill your father with the broken edge of a bottle, driving the glass into his neck and chest over and over again.\\n\\nNo one told father either, but when she turned, she turned so fast. He was holding a wine glass out, waiting for her to pour. She started to slur her speech, and the hand holding the wine bottle shook, clenched,  and suddenly flailed.

I ran as fast as I could.\\n\\nAn out-of-control hovercar slammed into our home and brought the upper floor down on mother, but she wasn't my mother by then. She was Ravenous, though I didn't know that. We didn't have the word yet. I just knew she was dead, like father.  I saw the light go out of her mad eyes.\\n\\nI almost gave up. I was so close to letting go. Then I saw the light. It was a ship.

Heck, I might never have figured it out if I was on my own. A Longhaul-class freighter doesn't just fly herself, and I had dials, sticks, and gages to manage. But ol' Mikee, he saw the way people on the ground weren't walking around like they usually did. Some of them were, I suppose, but we  later figured out those folks were probably dying. Most of them were running in groups in erratic ways.\\n\\nHe'd gotten me watching 'em too when we saw the killing start. Now the runners were biting and beating and dismembering any living creature they could find, which included their fellow Mordesh and some really unfortunate pets and livestock.\\n\\nIf we hadn't just unloaded most of our cargo, I probably wouldn't have done it, but something about the violence -  the sheer madness of it, you understand, the sudden horror of it - compelled me to act. \\n\\nMikee pointed out I should have listened to the news on the wireless band. Today, the Everlife Elixir was supposed to turn the Mordesh immortal. Victor Lazarin was gonna be the biggest hero the universe had ever seen, the man who killed death. Guess it went bad, huh?\\n\\nSo we swung the Arovolkin in low, looking for people who weren't crazy. Just to make sure we  didn't regret leaving for the rest of our lives, you know what I mean? That's when we saw the girl, must have been six or seven years old if she was a day - screaming, crying for her parents, confused, terrified. But she wasn't running at anyone, just from a half-collapsed building. I hit the landing lights, and we touched down just far enough away not to send the kid running away in terror.\\n\\nYashka didn't say much once she came onboard. I'm kind of surprised she did, in the end.  Two strange blue guys show up out of the sky and try to take you into space after watching your parents kill each other? Brave kid. \\n\\nOf course, we all had a chance to regret it not long after that. No sooner had we gotten our new passenger settled in and restrained - just in case - than the biggest fleet I've ever seen dropped into orbit from out of nowhere.\\n\\nAnd they dropped in firing. We took three hits before I even had time to raise the  defensive screens.

The ship came down calamitously, but the Ekose at the helm - Captain Barbio - brought her in without losing his co-pilot, their petite passenger, or anyone on the ground who hadn't already turned.\\n\\nI was especially grateful for that final fragment of fate. Like little Yashka, I too had lost many people already, but unlike her, I was not alone.  My wife had, at my insistence, taken our first dose of Everlife - the only one we could afford, to be truthful. She was transformed within minutes. My loving bride, a doting mother who spoiled our son at every opportunity, tried to kill him almost immediately. I was merely acting on instinct when I killed her. I was more deliberate when I killed the others on the way to the ship crash.\\n\\nI don't know what I expected. An escape pod capable of escape velocity, maybe? A cache of killbots to repel the  Ravenous? Instead, I found a pair of Ekose - a freighter captain and his shiphand first mate - along with little Yashka.\\n\\nThe next several days were a blur. The city was a charnel house, but our little group - me, the Ekose, my son, and the girl - somehow held out. The ship was largely intact, serving as a surprisingly sturdy shelter against the Ravenous hordes - the ones who made it past our weapons fire.\\n\\nThe Arovolkin had been a weapons smuggler. An  amazing stroke of luck. But even their stock began to run dry on the evening of the fourth day. Despite the corpses everywhere, the number of Ravenous seemed unchanged. We wondered if we were the last people truly alive and conscious on the planet - or possibly the universe.\\n\\nA call answered those final desperate questions just as we loaded in the last of our ammunition. A stealth shuttle from an Exile blockade runner was en route. They had the security codes for passing  the blockade courtesy of someone they only identified as the Widow. Of course, I now know who it was, and I'm amazed at her ability to organize what was left of us before it was too late. Had she not kept the mob from slaughtering Lazarin, let alone arranging for evacuation to the Exile Fleet, the Mordesh would never have survived. \\n\\nNow Yashka is grown and a soldier. My son Ulyn is a talented alchemist. Like me, their flesh is dead, but the Vitalus keeps us going. I do  not keep in touch with them as much as I should.\\n\\nI still see Captain Barbio and Mikee from time to time. They offer to buy me drinks, but I always decline.

He sent his tribe to fight it, but they were effortlessly annihilated in waves by this greatest of foes.\\n\\nFinally came Mog-Mog himself, his staff lifted in anger, the stuttering words of his primitive tongue voicing curses that would have  sundered the spirit of a lesser being. But not this... thing... this enemy the Moodies fear even more than they fear me.\\n\\nOnce again, Mog-Mog died. His body was broken, his mask was cracked, and his soul was wracked and ravaged.

What remained of his tribe tended to him, offering their own pitiful souls to his endless psychic buffet.  Eventually, his power returned, but ever did he fear the return of the black foe that had bested him and brought his reign to ruin.\\n\\nIn an act of desperation, Mog-Mog crafted a new mask to replace the one his enemy had cracked. He placed all of his fear, his ambition, and his power into this new mask, creating an artifact that would outlast him should the unthinkable come to pass.

We managed to scrape together just enough to pay the Protostar real estate man for a nice little plot on the ground. Not one of their fancy floating houses, that's just the sort of thing little Tyka would plumb walk right off. Sure, we spent all we had on the deed, and I'll have to take a few extra jobs here and there to get by at first, but the little green man promised us Nexus is the planet of new beginnings and  prosperous lives. And who can argue with that?\\n\\nAnd now here we are on board. We just departed the launch bay, and I've been given permission to head to the forward cabin to grab us a few refreshments.

Somethin' light-footed, on two legs, what ain't yetis. And there's a lot of 'em. Could swear I hear some kind of shoutin' going on up in the hills.

For like any group of people, there were good among the new settlers, and a few of the bad as well. In the case of Gallow's founding, the bad were pretty bad indeed, and it meant the good folk who wanted to live here had to build a gallows before they even built the first home alongside  the dusty thoroughfare.\\n\\nWe didn't even have a peacekeeper in town then, which made folk vulnerable to the worst kind of instincts humans got. The worst of the lot was a fellow name of Crowe and his family full of ne'er-do-wells and murderous thugs. Old Pappy Crowe had raised all his children mean and nasty, turning them into more a gang than a family. Eventually, all you had to do to earn the name \"Crowe\" was do something wicked on Pappy's orders.\\n\\nSo, expecting trouble, the  town founders rounded up all the Crowes in town and told them they should take their business elsewhere. Naturally, this didn't go over so well, and Pappy sent two of his biggest - Alf Crowe and his bigger brother Ugor - to burn down the tents and temporary structures that made up the as-yet-unnamed settlement. But the people of this new settlement were still Exiles, and Exiles fight for  what's theirs, whether it's a three-hundred-year-old starship or a spot of dirt on a distant planet they aim to call home. The settlers caught Alf and Ugor in the act and built the first permanent structure in town: the gallows what gave the place its name.\\n\\nPappy Crowe didn't like it much, but the folk of Gallow - as it was now called - had made their point. Pappy took his family up to the hills and stayed mostly out of town business. Folk here don't want any trouble with slush, that nasty  drink what the Crowes seem to specialize in, and the Crowes are keeping to themselves. Some say they've made contact with another criminal group, others that the Crowes are just making so much gold selling their foul brew offworld that they just ain't got time to bother with Gallow anymore. And a lot of folk say Pappy's running with the Krogg now and the Darkspur Cartel's the ones really pulling the strings. We'll just see about that. \\n\\nIf you ask this chronicler, this is a situation what can't hold. Pappy Crowe's always been one to hold a grudge, and he's had plenty of time to nurse this one. As I write this, a lot of folk are saying that our new peacekeeper can't show up soon enough. This chronicler tends to agree.",

And I'm going to be the Krogg to find it, take it, and use it to carve out my own little empire on this stars-forsaken planet.\\n\\nThe best part?

If you or someone you love are SERGEANT KARA OF FCON or you are a sentient being who knows of his or her current whereabouts, you are encouraged to contact your nearest Protostar Housing Agent today to report what  you know... for money!\\n\\nEven if you don't know anything about this situation, your nearest Protostar Housing Agent can set YOU up with the home of your dreams!

These \"Focus\" sites appear to be keyed to specific types of primal power and are all in various states of decay or disrepair. It is unknown what purpose these sites served for the ancient Eldan who must  have built them - or who at least discovered them.\\n\\nAll available data clearly indicates that the Focus of Air in the Galeras region is the most exposed and intact Focus on Nexus. Analysis shows this is due to the extreme territoriality of both the Falkrin and Pell groups that occupy the region around the Focus. To varying extents, they worship either the Eldan or their own primeval gods. \\n\\nThe Dominion's purpose with this Focus of Air should be quite obvious. This much raw power cannot be allowed  to fall into any hands but the emperor's. The power of the Focus of Air will fuel the imperial war machine that will, in turn, drive the hated Exiles from the surface of this holy world. These sub-sentient barbarians will be brought to heel before their betters... or they will be eliminated.\\n\\nThe Exiles have, unfortunately, seized a key strategic point by taking the ruins of Thayd, an ancient city unlike any Eldan site heretofore seen. The place's walls are shockingly strong. But Thayd is also on  the far side of here from the Focus, and neither the Falkrin nor the Pell seem any friendlier to the Exiles than they are to us.

Confident of his skills, the young Brightland took a bounty on an infamous Marauder: Captain Thokov. After tracking the captain to a seedy spaceport bar, Brightland walked in, drew his pistols and fixed the captain with a steely gaze.\\n\\n\"I'm bringin' you in, Thokov.

Drawing his own knife from a well-worn boot, Brightland squared off against Thokov, and soon a screaming crowd gathered around them, smelling blood in the air. \\n\\nThe two combatants circled around one another like feral beasts, dodging and weaving as their knives flashed in the smoky air. Relying on his snake-like reflexes  and raw, animal instinct, Brightland's blade soon drew blood, causing Thokov to cry out in rage and frustration - and after a few minutes it was obvious that Thokov had finally met his match.\\n\\nFearing that his captain would be defeated, Thokov's first mate Lieutenant Pragg intervened, breaking a bottle over Brightland's head. As Brightland staggered backwards from the treacherous sneak attack, Thokov's blade struck him viciously in the face - resulting in a bone-deep gash that turned his left eye into a  bloody ruin. In the ensuing chaos, the Marauder captain and his thuggish lieutenant disappeared into the screaming mob, vowing to take their revenge on Brightland when their paths crossed once again.\\n\\n Standing in the middle of the frenzied throng with blood running from the ruins of his eye, Brightland felt an icy rage.

The ship was cold and silent. The air tasted of oily smoke.\\n\\nIt had only been a few months since Kain had been sworn in by the legendary Judge Karl \"the Hangman\" Denshaw, and they had been busy months indeed. Rumor had it that the infamous Darkspur Cartel had infiltrated the fleet, and the Hangman had sworn to  take them down or die trying.\\n\\nDrawing their weapons, they ventured into the ship's interior, navigating by emergency lights recessed in the floor. They found corpses everywhere, presumably from the ship's crew. It was obvious there had recently been a gunfight, but now the ship was completely quiet. They stepped carefully over the grisly scene, passing into the shadowy depths of what looked like a deserted cargo hold.\\n\\nSuddenly, the air around them erupted in gunfire. An ambush! Kain and the Hangman  dove for cover, landing behind a stack of wooden crates. Smoke filled the room, and the laughter of Cartel thugs echoed hollowly in the hold. Kain looked over to Denshaw... and saw a dark stain spreading over the chest of the judge's uniform.\\n\\n\"Damn, Kain. They got me and got me good.\"\\n\\n\"Hang on, Judge,\" said Kain. \"I'll get you outta here.\"\\n\\n\"Too late for that. But you can do something for me.\"\\n\\n\"Name it.\"\\n\\nThe Hangman pulled the badge from his blood-soaked vest, and with a shaky hand pinned  it on Kain's uniform.\\n\\n\"You're ready for this,\" the Hangman said. \"Now swing the hammer of justice, and swing it hard.\"\\n\\nDenshaw's eyes flickered and closed. Cold fury rose up in Judge Kain.\\n\\n\"Consider it done,\" Kain said.\\n\\nKain stood, a pistol in each hand, firing at the Cartel thugs hiding in the depths of the hold. Kicking the wooden crates aside, he heedlessly walked into a deadly barrage of Cartel bullets like a vengeful wraith, his eyes lit with an unholy fire. First one enemy dropped, then  another, their laughter quickly becoming shouts of panic and fear. At some point he realized he was wounded, but the carnage didn't end until the last man lay dead on the floor.\\n\\nKain walked into a dark room on the other side of the cargo hold. At the center of the room was a holo-projector, and standing upon it was the flickering image of a large, well-dressed Krogg.\\n\\n\"Last one standin', huh?\" said the hologram. \"You cost me a lot of money today, lawman.\"\\n\\nKain said nothing.\\n\\n\"I'm Black Jack  Moragg. I like to be acquainted with people I'm gonna kill. And you are?\"\\n\\n\"The name's Kain. Remember it. Because I swear by the scales of Lady Justice, I'm gonna find you. And I'm gonna bury you.\" Then he tipped his hat, pulled his pistols from their holsters, and blew the holo-emitter to scrap.\\n\\nTurning to leave, Kain looked down at the badge pinned on his chest. There was blood on it, but whose it was he didn't know. He took hold of it, wiped it off with his sleeve, and walked out the room.",

The object had a neural core, but the Eldan code stored within was extremely complex and comprised of strange symbols. Mesmerized, she delved further, looking for larger  patterns, relying on the intuition that made her the best technologist in the fleet. \\n\\nAnd then it hit her. Those symbols were data-markers, and they were gateways.\\n\\nHer fingers tapped out the most logical pattern she could see. Immediately the sphere floated off the table and hung suspended in the air.\\n\\n\"Gotcha,\" Belle said. \\n\\nThe sphere responded immediately. Its outer shell unfolded a pair of powerful looking arms, one ending in appendages, the other in what looked like a weapon. Long  armored legs descended from the spherical torso to the deck of Belle's cabin. It aimed its weapon arm at the young human. \\n\\n\"PROTECT THE PROJECT,\" the Eldan construct said. \\n\\nBelle dove out of the way as an acrid beam of energy burned a glowing orange hole in the door behind her. \"Shootin' stars!\" she cursed. She tapped the datachron on her wrist. \"Bolt! Rusty! Code-Priority-Get-Your-Blasted-Cans-Back-In-Here!\"\\n\\nThe construct fired again. Belle hit the deck just in time, but the beam punched a hole  in the viewport that violently depressurized the cabin. Belle clutched at the nearest anchor, the bolted-down legs of her dining table. \\n\\nThe construct had mass, but not balance. With nothing to grasp, it flew headfirst into the shattered viewport and lodged there like a cork, helplessly flailing its arms and legs but still firing its plasma weapon.

Still lodged in the ship's hull, its arms and legs folded in on themselves. Moments later the construct was once again a sphere, albeit one holding all the air inside Belle's cabin.\\n\\n\"Well,\" Belle said, admiring the new decor. \"Daddy always said if at first you don't succeed, try breakin' somethin'.\" With a grin, she retrieved a laser cutter and eyed the dormant construct. \"Happy birthday to me.\"",

At Kara's signal, they fanned out, heading toward the sound of a fierce firefight. Surveying the battlefield from behind a stone outcrop, Kara had to admit things looked pretty grim. Durek and his squad were in a bad spot, caught between two intersecting lines of fire. The commander was still alive, but he was running out of time. It was now or never. Kara set her jaw, shouldered her rifle, and gave the signal to fire.\\n\\nTo Kara's  surprise, the attack went exactly as she'd planned. The rescue depended on hitting the enemy hard from multiple directions and convincing them that a much larger force had been deployed against them. Coordinated grenades created the illusion of serious firepower, while a constant deadly barrage of bullets kept the enemy pinned down. Battered by firepower on both sides, the enemy broke ranks and scattered. \\n\\nA proud Kara led her troops to the commander's location. Battered, bruised, but still very much  alive, Durek stood up, lit a cigar, then placed a hand on Kara's shoulder.\\n\\n\"Not bad, kid. Not bad.\"\\n\\n\"Not bad? Pretty sure I just saved your ass, Durek. Guess that makes me Private Kara.\"\\n\\n\"I don't think so.\"\\n\\nKara's smile faded, and she turned to go, but Durek's voice rang out behind her.\\n\\n\"Destroyers, ten... HUT! All salute, Sergeant Kara!\"\\n\\nThe mercs' thunderous cheer was the sweetest music she'd ever heard. Durek chomped his cigar, gave her a crisp salute, and walked away.",

    "content": "If he'd been in a tougher situation, Dorian Walker couldn't remember it.\\n\\nIt had been only a few days since he'd found Nexus, and just a few hours since he'd set the Blue Horizon down at the south end of a long canyon in the middle of a windswept region he'd nicknamed Galeras. As soon as he'd stepped off the ramp, a group of strange aliens had appeared out of the mist and forcibly taken him to their small village at the end of the canyon. They called themselves the Pell.\\n\\nEverything in their village,  from the dilapidated huts to the mysterious glowing totems, appeared to be made from scavenged pieces of what he assumed must be Eldan technology. \\n\\nNow Dorian was tied to a pseudo-technological altar made of bones and feathers, surrounded by smoky torches thrust into the sands of the canyon floor. A tall, elaborately dressed Pell stood before him; a priest of some kind, unless Dorian missed his mark. The priest called out in a strange, guttural tongue, and soon the hunched, birdlike forms of Pell  villagers emerged from the shadows, wrapped in tattered robes. Chanting incomprehensibly they shuffled forward, flickering firelight glinting in their beady, menacing eyes.\\n\\nThings being what they were, Dorian thought he'd better reason with them.\\n\\n\"Hey there, chief. Name's Dorian Walker. I'm new around here. Don't want any trouble.\"\\n\\n\"We are the Disciples of Air. You came from the sky. Did the Masters send you?\" the priest rasped.\\n\\n\"Yes and no,\" Dorian replied. \"I did come from up there, but I  can't say that I know any masters.\" \\n\\n\"We serve the Masters, but the Masters are gone,\" the Pell said. \"Still, their great work must continue.\"\\n\\n\"Ah. Well, I can see you're busy. If you'd be so kind to untie me, I'll just be on my way.\"\\n\\n\"You will aid the Disciples. You will continue the great work.\" A chill ran down Dorian's spine, as the priest raised a staff into the air. \"As a sacrifice to the Masters!\"\\n\\nThe staff crackled with blue electricity. Dorian figured time for peaceful first contact  had officially run out. \\n\\nUsing the strength of his cybernetic arm, Dorian broke free of the ragged ropes that held him. As the priest screamed in surprise and rage, Dorian leapt to his feet, grabbed a hyperflare from a pouch on his belt, clenched his eyes shut, and threw it to the ground with all his might. The flare exploded with the light of a small sun, casting giant twisted shadows on the surrounding canyon walls.\\n\\n\"Masters' Fire!\" the high priest shrieked, and the assembled Pell fell to the  ground and collectively wailed in agony. That gave Dorian the opening he needed. With every ounce of energy in his septuagenarian frame, he charged back to the Blue Horizon, disabling the security lockouts as he ran. By the time the Pell saw he was gone, the ship was blasting off into the atmosphere on a column of blue-white smoke. \\n\\n\"I really did regret that,\" Dorian would later write in his journal, \"They seemed like nice enough folk. Once you looked past the fact that they wanted to kill you.\"",

    "content": "The sound of a horn shattered the deep silence of the Blackridge Plain. Surrounded by a throng of heavily armed warriors, the tribal leaders of the Seven Stone Nations exited their tent and stood in a solemn line before the murmuring crowd. \\n\\nThe war against the Dominion invaders had been raging for weeks. Although the battle-hardened Granok had fought fearlessly, the superior technology of the Dominion was too powerful. Hundreds of thousands of the Seven Nations' mightiest warriors had fallen in battle.  The War of Gnox was all but done.\\n\\n\"We will not betray the ancient creed,\" they said. \"To the end, we will follow the Way of Stone.\"\\n\\nTheir words were terse and few. They would not adopt the ways of these strange invaders. They would not steal their weapons or use their machines of war. If this path led to death, then so be it.\\n\\nThe assembled Granok stoically accepted their fate - all but one. Driven by a seething hatred of the Dominion, a young warlord named Durek refused the elders. Proud and  defiant, Durek and a band of bold warriors gathered in secret, then swore a blood oath that they would destroy the invaders or die trying. \\n\\n\"That was the hard part,\" Durek rumbled to his followers. \"Tomorrow, we get to have some fun.\"\\n\\nThey attacked a Dominion military camp at dawn. With a thunderous shout, Durek waded into battle wielding a mighty warhammer. The Dominion soldiers who challenged him were scattered like broken toys, their armor shattered from the force of his attack. Dropping his ham mer, Durek reached down and picked up a Dominion rifle, his finger just barely fitting inside the trigger guard. The weapon let loose a powerful barrage of energy, felling another dozen soldiers. Other Granok warriors soon did the same.\\n\\nMoments later, a massive explosion threw Durek to the ground. Stunned but alive, he staggered to his feet and ran towards the armored Dominion vehicle that had launched the explosive. Closing the distance in a matter of seconds, Durek leapt on top of it, ripped off its  access hatch, and threw the vehicle's terrified driver to the ground.\\n\\nDurek squeezed into the cockpit, looking over the blinking lights on the console. Despite the disapproval of the tribal elders, Durek had closely studied the shattered wrecks of Dominion machines - and now he placed his hands gingerly on what he assumed was the steering mechanism. The machine lurched, and then rumbled forward in response.\\n\\nA red button was blinking just above his thumb. Weapons systems.\\n\\nDurek hesitated, his  finger poised. The words uttered by the Chief Elder the day before echoed in his head: To betray the Way of Stone is to renounce what makes us Granok. It chips away our identity and will lead only to suffering, misery, and death\\n\\nHe gazed through the viewscreen at the Dominion soldiers. They had invaded his home. Killed his people. Destroyed everything that he held dear.\\n\\nSetting his jaw, he hit the button.",

Add to that the fact that he was a stubby runt with a big mouth and a bad attitude, and it was no surprise that Mondo was having trouble getting a leg up.\\n\\nThe only things in his miserable, pathetic life that brought him any joy whatsoever were the machines that he stole from the sub-basement. The place had been used as storage by a now-bankrupt industrial vacu-bot manufacturer, and Mondo had spent hours studying the rusty machines he'd  unapologetically filched from it. He liked the machines. They made sense to him.\\n\\nHeavy footsteps echoed on the stairs below. The killers were ascending. He only had a few minutes left to finish his work.\\n\\nThe killers in question were Finkle Blurg and his merry band of half-wits. Blurg was the resident bully, an imbecilic goon with a lazy eye, stunted ears, and three missing teeth. Armed with low levels of intelligence and empathy, Blurg and his henchmen had been terrorizing their fellow orphans for  years, and they had recently set their sights on Mondo.\\n\\nAfter a number of painful beatings, Mondo decided to strike back. Playing the sycophantic groveler, Mondo had offered Blurg an adorable Bezgerlorian tarbeetle - a gift that he had gladly accepted. Five minutes later, the insect had promptly exploded, covering Blurg and his cronies in a sticky black ooze that would require major surgery to remove.\\n\\nThe footfalls stopped just outside the small door. Mondo's hands worked feverishly. So close....\\n\\n The door shattered, ripped from its hinges by the force of Blurg's boot. The angry youth stomped into the room, one side of his face and most of his body covered in the tarbeetle's death excretion. His minions, at least those able to make the trip, had not fared any better.\\n\\n\"You're so dead, runt,\" spat Blurg.\\n\\nMondo raised the object in his hands and pointed it at Finkle Blurg. The once-antiquated vacu-bot had undergone a dramatic transformation, and was sporting various tubes, wires, and one very  large red button.\\n\\n\"Bye bye,\" Mondo said, and pushed the button.\\n\\nA bright beam of energy shot out from the machine in his hands. Moments later, Blurg and his friends exploded into billions of tiny glowing particles. Mondo smiled. The black ooze was no longer going to be a problem.\\n\\nMondo set the particle destabilizer on the ground, staring out the small window of his attic as the glowing bits of his enemies floated dreamily around him. Surely the Dominion could use someone with his talents....",

    "content": "The perpetual inferno of Mount Crucible glowed angrily against the night sky, framed by roiling black clouds laced with lightning. The ground shook violently, as burning rocks and lava fell from the sky. There were few places in the entire galaxy more dangerous than where they now stood.\\n\\nAnd on top of it all, Artemis Zin was having difficulty doing her make-up.\\n\\nKevo, her stoic man-at-arms, lifelong teacher, and steadfast companion, summed up the situation with his usual understated panache.\\n\\n \"Mistress, if we stay here, we die.\"\\n\\nArtemis laughed. \\n\\n\"Go if you must, Kevo. But I am not leaving with my face looking like this.\"\\n\\nKevo growled, setting his jaw. She knew the aged Draken warrior would never leave her side.\\n\\nDespite the vehement warnings of friends, family, and concerned diplomats, Artemis had decided to scale Mount Crucible on planet Mikros with nothing more than Kevo, two cambots, and her own sense of impeccable style. She was now broadcasting the event live, and  her already astronomical viewership had skyrocketed.\\n\\nThe ground shook again, and the mountain belched fire. A deadly gout of molten lava descended upon them from above.\\n\\n\"I suppose that will have to do,\" she said, with a final glance in the mirror. And then they both ran for their lives.\\n\\nThey traversed up a ridge of volcanic rock that zig-zagged toward the precipice. The cambots hovered around them, skillfully framing the best shots. Often, they would zoom in on Artemis' face, capturing her grim  determination just before she broke into the sly smile that had garnered her incomprehensible fame and fortune.\\n\\nProgress was slow, but eventually they came to rest on a large outcropping near the lip of the volcano. Suddenly, an unholy shriek sounded from above, and moments later, a scaly, winged abomination landed on the ground in front of them. It was a deadly, two-headed zogwyrm. And it was hungry.\\n\\n\"Well,\" Artemis sighed, \"if we live, it will be fantastic for ratings.\"\\n\\nKevo sprang into action,  his blade unsheathed, cleanly lopping off one of the beast's heads with a flawless strike. Screaming in pain, the beast lashed out with its tail and sent Kevo sprawling. Artemis jumped in between them, firing pistols at the creature's remaining head. This time, the beast was ready, dodging with lightning-quick reflexes and knocking Artemis to the ground. Jaws slathering, it moved in for the kill. \\n\\nWithout warning, the outcropping broke away, shaken loose by the mountain's violent eruptions. The zogwyrm  screamed and plummeted below. Artemis would have done the same, but Kevo, clinging to the mountainside, reached out at the last moment and caught her hand.\\n\\nThey climbed to the precipice. The heat was almost unbearable, but together they looked down into the fiery maw of Mount Crucible.\\n\\nAfter a few moments, she collected her cambots and looked at the footage. Kevo stood grimly at her side.\\n\\n\"Oh, bother,\" she said, smiling. \"One of them malfunctioned. We're going to have to do it all again.\"",

All of Cassus mourned the passing of its great leader. Walking alongside the elevated coffin of his cousin, a young Luminai noble named Myrcalus seethed with rage.\\n\\nJarec of House Azrion ascended the throne after the tumultuous reign of Tyrani the Mad. Fearless and devout, he founded the Vigilant Church and restored his people's  faith in the empire. But death came for Jarec too soon. He died in his sleep, the victim of a subtle poison.\\n\\nJarec was childless, and Vorios of House Chaul was next in succession to the throne. Although many believed that Vorios was responsible for Jarec's death, there was no direct proof of wrongdoing. Within days, he wore the emperor's crown.\\n\\nThe empire was once again thrown into chaos. Assassinations were common among the Seven Houses, and a lack of economic development quickly drained the empire 's treasury. There was unrest amongst lowborn and highborn alike, threatening to plunge the Dominion into another civil war.\\n\\nStanding before Jarec's tomb, Myrcalus of House Azrion swore to avenge his fallen emperor. Secretly aided by Axis Pheydra of the ICI, Myrcalus relentlessly followed a fading trail of witnesses and conspirators, until finally forcing a confession from the assassin who had delivered the poison to Vorios himself.\\n\\nStrengthened by a terrible resolve, Myrcalus stormed from his family  house to the emperor's palace. In his hand was Indominar, the sword once wielded by Azrion the Conqueror himself. As he approached the massive doors of the throne room, Myrcalus was stopped by the Draken throneguard stationed in front of them.\\n\\n\"Draken brethren,\" Myrcalus said, \"I come to vindicate Jarec the Vigilant, whom I know you loved and served faithfully. Let me pass, and I will deliver us from this time of darkness.\"\\n\\nThe captain was silent, studying the young Luminai and the legendary blade i n his hand. With an almost inaudible grunt, the captain ordered the throneguard into formation behind Myrcalus.\\n\\nMyrcalus threw open the doors and saw Vorios perched upon the throne. Realizing the intent of the young Luminai, a trio of guards loyal to House Chaul rushed to stop him - but Myrcalus skillfully slew them all with the ancient blade of House Azrion.\\n\\nSurrounded by the corpses of his enemies, Myrcalus stalked up the dais to the throne. Vorios cringed and trembled as Myrcalus approached , his wide eyes locked on blood-stained Indominar. He slunk to the floor, taking the crown off his head and offering it up to Myrcalus.\\n\\n\"Take it! It's yours!\" Vorios said.\\n\\n\"For once, you speak the truth,\" answered Myrcalus. He cleaved the murderer in two.\\n\\nWithin hours, citizens of the Dominion were rejoicing in the streets, hailing their new emperor. In Myrcalus, the people saw the strength and honor of Dominus himself - and many began to say that he was truly the Half-Blood reborn.",

Not surprising, seeing diseases and ailments among their kind, but three in one day raises some concerns. Recommended a series of standard-strength medishots twice per day to all three patients. Standard medishots should be more than enough to destroy any potential contagions - if this is indeed a contagiou s disease - to near-zero. I hope this isn't something going around. I have real science to do here. I don't have time to play nursemaid for every lowborn sod who stubs his toe.\\n\\n-Day 02\\nSeven more cases today with the same symptoms, all among lowborn. All were employed at the Hycrest starship facilities in some capacity - laborers or service personnel. More disturbingly, I have heard from none of the three previous patients, and they are not responding to datachron messages. I am going with a more poten t suite of medishots for these patients, including a slow-release anti-viral and inoculation against all known space plagues. I've also informed these patients that they will be required to remain under observation for the next twenty-four hours or until I know what happened to the three from yesterday.\\n\\n-Day 04\\nThis is, to put it mildly, not good. Fifty-two new patients since last I had a chance to make a note in this... well, at this point I'd have to call it a plague diary. Because there's no doubt  in my mind. That's what this is. I just need to understand how it's spreading if I'm going to kill it. That means I have to contemplate something I don't really want to contemplate. \\nLetting this thing run its course through the lowborn for a while.\\nAll my ethics are against it, but I have to be a realist. It would be far simpler to isolate the relatively small number of highborn Cassians in Hycrest from the infected lowborn than quarantine all the lowborn from the highborn.\\nI also must make sure this  journal never falls into the wrong hands. What a thing to admit: allowing the Hycrest Plague to take hold without trying hard enough to stop it!\\n\\n-Day 07\\nMore than two hundred cases, now. Twenty-three deaths, including two highborn elders who insisted on dying in their homes, infecting their servants and who knows how many relatives. We must find a cure for this before it spreads to the rest of our territory on Nexus. Or worse - to the other worlds of the Dominion. \\nMy decision to allow the disease to  spread among the lowborn was correct. Today, a breakthrough! A patient awakened from an artificially induced coma on her own. The girl - a teenager, the noble daughter of a local lowborn merchant - said she had witnessed a vision of another girl about her age, hooded and hidden yet alight with holy fire, calling her name just before she awakened. She has requested permission to return home, but I haven't the heart to tell her the rest of her family is already raving with the sickness.",

The towering Osun warlord, so confident of victory moments before, screamed in shock and pain as most of his body below the waist disintegrates into raw atoms. He continued to scream as his upper torso dropped with a sickeningly wet crunch onto the smoldering remains of his  shins, driving the jagged edges of his leg bones deep into his lower abdomen. Still screaming, the grotesque creature - who now appeared to have feet growing directly out of his mangled and bleeding intestinal cavity - swung his massive, meaty arms at the quick-footed Chua. Ludo easily rolled out of the way, then brought up his molecular destabilizer ray for another blast. This one caught the warlord a glancing blow alongside his face, stripping the flesh to the bone and forcing an even less intelligible  bellow from the dying warlord that sprayed blood, spittle, and pieces of flesh into the air.\\n\\nTwo more shots, and the Osun was armless and still roaring in agony. With a slightly unhinged laugh, Ludo stepped back, took careful aim at the Osun's face, and asked, \"You see now, yes yes?\"\\n\\n\"Kill me,\" the Osun gasped, his strength bleeding out into the muddy soil. With half his face missing, it sounded more like \"kith mith,\" but Ludo was able to understand.\\n\\n\"Yep yep! I think you understand after all. And  good news! No one will miss stupid warlord when gone. Because Ludo going to kill your whole tribe!\"\\n\\nThe warlord continued to beg for death, but he would have to wait.

    "content": "[This battered volume seems to detail the myths and legends of Wilderrun, though very little fact is established based on the tall tales between the book's covers.\\n\\nAn excerpt reads...]\\n\\nWilderrun is fraught with peril, from the carnivorous plants that comb the jungle floor for unfortunate explorers, to the giant vesquettoes that can drain a man of blood in a handful of seconds. Many creatures call the sultry forest their home, and even those normally herbivorous creatures seem to crave the quivering  flesh of sentients over the bitter and oftentimes poisonous leaves of the indigenous flora.\\n\\n[Another excerpt reads...]\\n\\nLegends state that a number of stone statues resembling the heads of giant Granok females - only prettier - were scattered throughout Wilderrun by the members of a razortail-worshipping cult of exceptional cruelty and viciousness. All who have reported such statues have disappeared without a trace, though it is commonly assumed they were killed by cultists or enraged  monkeys...\\n\\n[A final excerpt reads...]\\n\\nLet us not forget the barbarous women that roam Wilderrun. Of all the jungle's denizens, they are perhaps the most dangerous. They survive on the flesh of male sentients, refusing to dine on captured females. Female sentients who are unfortunate enough to be abducted by these cruel harridans are instead fed to their pet pumera.",

    "content": "[This old book is marred by bloodstains, the cover displaying signs of damage from large teeth or claws. The author is listed as Dulonus Pola, a self-proclaimed \"master of holistic medicine and animal-based curatives.\" Though the title alludes that the subject matter is confined to pumera bites, it also covers the (purported) pharmacological uses of the pumera's physiology.\\n\\nThe following chapter concerns first aid.]\\n\\n \"The survivability rate for victims of pumera bites is pitifully low. The saliva of pumera is rife with bacteria and germs, which leads to horrible infections that are typically fatal and unresponsive to medicines of any kind. Given the pumera's habit of cleaning its body with its tongue, this is hardly surprising. If bitten, victims should seek out medical attention immediately. Even if such help is found, victims should expect to expire, anyway. At this point, victims should endeavor  to complete their last will and testament, and make suitable arrangements for their inevitable passing.\"\\n\\n[Another section speaks of pumera whiskers:]\\n\\n\"Of all the parts of the pumera, the whiskers are the most valuable. When carefully snipped from the muzzle of a still-living pumera, such whiskers can be ground into a fine powder and mixed with equal parts snoglug slime and girrok bile.  When consumed, this concoction will cure nearly any ailment, with the only exception being the septic infection resulting from a pumera bite.",

The Dominion armada had found its prey. Outnumbered and outgunned, the battered rebel fleet of the traitorous Serrick Brightland, his previous commander and mentor, clustered together on the far side of the planet.\\n\\nBrightland was using a classic tactic: hiding his fleet in the gravity well of the planet. It was a maneuver Caeson knew well, one he had learned  from Brightland himself. After their last skirmish, the rebel fleet was in desperate need of repairs, but Caeson had tracked them down before they were able to complete them. \\n\\nOn Caeson's command, coruscating weapons-fire lit up the skies, systematically wearing down the enemy's shields. As the Exiles struggled to return fire, Caeson watched a crippled ship decay from orbit, trailing fire as it fell toward the planet's surface. The timing was perfect. Victory was inevitable. \\n\\nThe Exiles began their  retreat, and the Dominion pursued them. Aurelius knew that the planet's gravity well made jumping to hyperspeed impossible, and the empire's attack ships would be well in range before the rebels could reach safe distance.\\n\\nBut just as Aurelius prepared to target the fleeing vessels, Brightland turned his warship and set a course directly for the Radiant itself. \\n\\nAurelius's armada unleashed every battery and cannon it had in response, engulfing the approaching ship in ghostly zero-g flame. Behind it,  Exile starship spindrives flashed one by one, leaving their leader alone and undefended. Brightland's suicidal maneuver had saved the remaining rebel ships, but his imminent death would mean an end to their pathetic rebellion. Caeson's armada could easily hunt down rebel stragglers once this final deed was done.\\n\\nDespite taking heavy damage, Brightland's ship relentlessly continued its collision course with the Radiant. Caeson fired his full arsenal on the approaching ship, destroying its few remaining  defenses. In the midst of the violent barrage, Aurelius received an incoming call: Brightland was hailing him. \\n\\nThe image of his mentor appeared on the command screen. He was obviously wounded, leaning heavily upon his ship's navigation console, coughing and spitting blood. \\n\\n\"This is not over... Aurelius.\"\\n\\nThe Dominion captain stoically regarded his old friend and mentor, burying the visceral pain caused by his betrayal. \\n\\n\"It is for you, traitor.\" \\n\\nChunks of hull plating flew from the two  ships as they hurtled toward impact. Aurelius ordered his men to stay the course, prepared to die in order to ensure Brightland's death. But just before the two ships collided, the rebel warship jumped into hyperspace and was gone. \\n\\nAurelius cried out in rage.

He was in the legendary Temple of Dak-Buun, where no Lopp had ever walked before.\\n\\nRaising a glowstick, he studied the chamber. Upon the far wall, there was a vibrant painting of a fantastical blue spirit, surrounded by kneeling Lopp, with inset gems appearing to rain down upon them. The floor leading up to the painting was a complex grid of colorful tiles.\\n\\nSensing a trap, Diki inched forward. He had already survived the Corridor of a Thousand K nives, the Chamber of Flame, and the Labyrinth of Whirling Blades. One false step, and he was certain something bad would happen.\\n\\nHe scrutinized the floor tiles. They formed a pattern he had seen long ago on the ancient Tapestry of Raatha-Shugg, woven to display the stars of Lagos. But which tiles were safe? Of course! Those that represented the constellation of Oonga, Hunter of Shinies! His tiny Lopp feet danced across the floor, bouncing from one safe tile to the next. Soon he was across the room, sta nding before a massive, ornate archway.\\n\\nSuddenly, the chamber echoed with the sound of heavy footsteps. Like many Lopp, he was never without his faithful kurg, Shaggy, and the bulky beast had somehow managed to follow him into the temple. Looking back, Diki saw the curious kurg poking his snout into the chamber.\\n\\n\"Shaggy, no!\" he shouted. \"Room is dangerous. Very, very dangerous!\"\\n\\nDiki took cover as the kurg crashed into the room. Its big paw stomped on several tiles, and the walls shook. Diki da shed through the archway, hoping that Shaggy would survive the trap and follow him into the next chamber.\\n\\nDiki turned to see the room behind him collapse violently. Shaggy was nowhere to be seen! Sadness overwhelmed the tiny Lopp, but he couldn't turn back now. \\n\\nAhead of him, illuminated by a single shaft of light, was the prize he sought. The shiniest of shinies. The iridescent pearl known as the Relic of Dak-Buun! Still grieving for his lost friend, he approached it, hoping against hope that the le gends were true. With a trembling paw, he rubbed its surface.\\n\\nA brilliant light suffused the room, and a magnificent spectral entity rose from the pearl. The legendary spirit Dak-Buun!\\n\\n\"FINALLY! I AM FREE! I WILL THANK YOU BY GRANTING ONE WISH!\"\\n\\nDiki fell to his knees. \"Dak-Buun!\" he implored. \"Diki beseeches you! More than fame or fortune or shinies, Diki wants one thing. Diki wants his beloved kurg back!\"\\n\\nThe room shook with a thunderous rumble. He looked back to see Shaggy wriggle his way ou t from under a pile of rubble. Barreling forward, it gleefully knocked Diki to the ground.\\n\\n\"My kurg!\" Diki shouted. \"Shaggy lives!\"\\n\\n\"YOUR WISH HAS BEEN GRANTED!\" intoned Dak-Buun.\\n\\n\"Very, very good!\" said Diki.\\n\\nDak-Buun beamed with joy. \"AND MY WISH HAS BEEN GRANTED! AS WE ARE TRAPPED HERE, I NOW HAVE SOMEONE TO TALK TO FOR ETERNITY!\"\\n\\nAs the light of his glowstick began to fade, Diki contemplated his next adventure: escaping from the legendary Temple of Dak-Buun!",

Almost.\\n\\nOne by one the wasp-waisted humanoids slowly turned to evaluate him. One creature slowly reached for its weapon, and the Aurin furrowed his brow. Would they stun him? Was that an electroprod? That gave him an idea.\\n\\nSubject 33 leapt to a hatch on the wall, grabbed the valve that opened it, and held on. With a thought, he hurled a psychic blade across the room, connecting with  an electrical panel. A sparking metal box dropped to the ground. Hip-deep in water, his captors twitched like ragdolls shaken in a dagun's mouth. \\n\\n33 spun the valve until the hatch opened and tumbled through. Straight ahead, red lights flashed in a long corridor. Through an aperture at the far end, he could see outside. Blue sky. White clouds. Calm waters. Freedom.\\n\\nSubject 33 ran. Turrets in the walls and ceiling rained fiery death, missing him by inches. The Aurin ran faster.\\n\\nA calm, alien voice  made a stern announcement over an intercom. \"Observation: Aurin subject escaping.\" 33 took in a deep breath of fresh sea air as he leapt toward the aperture.\\n\\nSteel shutters dropped. The exit slammed shut. He fell to the ground.\\n\\nThe voice returned. \"Verification: performance test concluded. Capture and prepare for vivisection.

What I can do is continue to work on a cure that will truly heal our people and allow us to walk unburdened by Vitalus once more. To that end, I am pleased to announce Lazarin's Own Alchemical Products, a line of quality goods that will directly improve the lives of all Mordesh. And please note, whatever you may think of me, that I  am not interested in profit. The proceeds from these products will go directly to research into a cure for the Contagion, which, as you know, is my life's work. I will not rest until we are free of this curse, even if I can never undo the results of my hubris. \\n\\nYours in suffering,\\nDr. Victor Lazarin\\n\\nLazarin's Own Primal Epidermis Rejuvenator\\nEvery Mordesh knows the heartbreak of dry, flaky skin and the inevitable, nightmarish itching sensation that results. Vitalus can keep us alive, but can it  keep our graying skin smooth and supple? Of course not. But Lazarin's Own Primal Epidermis Rejuvenator can! Just one jar of this lotion per day applied liberally to exposed skin will prevent flaking and itching for a full 72 standard hours! Do not accept cheap Protostar knockoffs that only mask the itching and moisten the skin with artificial lubricants. Infuse your necrotic flesh with primal moisture from the labs of Victor Lazarin!\\n\\nLazarin's Own Herbal Intoxicant Tea\\nDue to the sensitivity of  Vitalus implants, many Mordesh find the consumption of alcoholic beverages to be a very bad idea. Too many times have intoxicated Mordesh failed to refill their Vitalus stores, or worse, failed to recognize the signs that a friend has become Ravenous. That's where Lazarin's Own Herbal Intoxicant Tea comes in! Lazarin's Own isn't derived from alcohol, but relies on natural supplements grown by friendly Aurin herbalists to trigger the relaxation centers of the brain, diminishing anxiety, paranoia, and mild  joint and epidermal pain. Not habit-forming. Outlawed on the planet Cassus, but then, so are Mordesh.\\n\\nLazarin's Own Alchemical Pet Sealant\\nMany Mordesh go through their lives alone, rarely knowing the friendship of another being or the touch of a friendly domesticated beast, all for fear of accidentally triggering a Contagion outbreak. Now Lazarin's Own Alchemical Pet Sealant can allow you and your furry, slimy, or scaly friends to cavort and frolic without fear of cross-species contamination.  Just spray a bottle of Lazarin's Own on your favorite jabbit, vind, dagun, or chompacabra and enjoy each others' company for up to 24 standard hours without reapplication!

Like all exo- labs discovered thus far, it appears to be dedicated to a particular set of experiments; unlike many of those same exo-labs, this one is almost completely intact and functional - making it an even more noteworthy discovery than  suspected.\\n\\nExo-Lab 71 is not a large facility, but it appears to be capable of drawing a tremendous amount of life energy from its immediate surroundings. Currently, the exo-lab is in a sort of standby mode, but it is nevertheless channeling power to the entity designated \"Elderoot.\"\\n\\nThere can be little doubt that Exo-Lab 71 was directly related to the enhancement of the Elderoot entity. Further investigation will be required if we are to  co-opt this technology and use it in our ongoing search for a cure to the Contagion.",

    "title": "The Livingroot Phenomenon",
    "content": "Field Study Day 2\\nI've been off Arboria too long. Today, I could have sworn a root vegetable said \"hello\" to me as I walked past. I attempted to reply, but the root vegetable then remained stubbornly silent. Of course, this was no ordinary root vegetable, but what we are tentatively calling \"sprouts\" for lack of a better term. They are plants, but also mobile. A truly strange phenomenon. Am I crazy to think one of them spoke to me? Nothing  surprises me on this planet, and I've only been here a couple of days!\\n\\nField Study Day 4\\nIt happened again. But this time, the sprout said more than \"hello.\" This time, I had short, stilted, but definitely two-way conversation with one! I'm not certain it's the same one who spoke to me before, but it could well be. It told me it was called a Livingroot Grower and that it was a \"friend of Elderoot.\" It seems these sprouts take care of the big, sentient  tree that is at the heart of Everstar Grove. I cannot wait until the queen arrives and can meet these amazing creatures!\\n\\nField Study Day 7\\nAfter days of searching, and talking to any sprout I could find, I finally tracked down my friend the Livingroot Grower. He - I can no longer think of him as an \"it\" - was disturbed, even frightened. He said that Elderoot was concerned at the influx of settlers arriving in his grove. The old tree has been here a long  time, the sprout told me, but never before had the sprout seen Elderoot in such distress! But after further examination of the strange enhancements attached to the tree's root system, I think I've spotted the real reason for Elderoot's distress. An infestation of insects have burrowed up from beneath the surface and are consuming his roots! I assured the Livingroot Grower that I would tell someone. I just hope I can get this report to the others  before the queen arrives. I want her to meet Elderoot so much. Our queen has sacrificed so much. Leaving Arboria was hard for all of us, but I think it almost killed Queen Myala. So meeting a wise tree like Elderoot will surely help her feel better. I just know they'll be the best of friends!",

    "content": "[A medical assessment of the Aurin queen's health based on an examination recently conducted by a Mordesh doctor.]\\n\\nPATIENT QME-1\\n\\nSYMPTOMS: Fatigue, chronic pain, dizziness, nausea, insomnia.\\n\\nDIAGNOSIS: QME-1 has a unique primal connection to her homeworld. It appears her connection to Arboria is traumatizing her every time the Planet Reapers turn a tree to dust. The distance from the Aurin Homeworld has, according to the  patient's own assessment, only caused symptoms to increase in intensity. Lacking a more plausible explanation that would defy all known primal physics, I hypothesize that proximity to Nexus and the intense sources of primal life energy in Aurin territories amplifies the patient's sensitivity to these fluctuations in what her kind call \"the Weave.\"\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Although the patient is able to achieve a stable equilibrium using  personal meditation techniques, drawing on primal life sources on Nexus, and simply by getting rest, this situation cannot continue if the patient is to survive. The effort to suppress the pain of Arboria and still function in her role as monarch is taking a severe toll. \\n\\nI find this particularly frustrating as a doctor, for the solution to this ailment is simple. The patient is capable of severing the connection to Arboria. She insists that, once severed, she would be unable to  reestablish the same thread in this \"Weave,\" and so she refuses to follow this guaranteed course of relief. \\n\\nPending the patient's willingness to follow the recommended treatment, a continued course of natural alchemical pain remedies is all I can offer.\\n\\nADDITIONAL: Medical conscience compels me to bring my concerns to the First Consort. The patient is too important to her people, and to us all, to allow her to go on  this way. Perhaps he can convince her to do what must be done. I fear he will instead recommend they return to their homeworld, where they will surely die.\\n\\nI should really find the organ containing my medical conscience and replace it with something more useful.",

As he'd been in kind of a hurry when stealing the ship, there hadn't exactly been time to kick the tires.\\n\\nLike he'd always said, a stupid plan could only go two ways: bad and worse. Now he only had a few minutes of air left, and no idea where he was going.\\n\\nStill, it wasn't like he'd had much of a choice. The Exile Fleet was in a bad spot, heavily damaged after they'd rescued  the Aurin on Arboria. Time and resources were running out, and it was only a matter of time before the Dominion caught up to them. They needed a new home, and Dorian was going to find it.\\n\\nOf course, that depended on him surviving the next few minutes. He had enough air and fuel left for one more hyperjump, and then it was the end of the road.\\n\\nDorian's weathered volume of The Book of Dominus sat propped open on a nearby console. Worn, dog-eared and heavily annotated, the apocryphal book had been in  his family for centuries. Like many of his ancestors, Dorian was convinced it held the secret to finding Nexus, which, of course, had led to stealing the Blue Horizon.\\n\\nThat questionable decision had been made after he'd spoken to Klegg, a grizzled old spacer he'd met in a bar on the Gambler's Ruin. After hearing Klegg describe an oddly shaped nebula he'd seen way out beyond the Fringe, Dorian had been convinced that it pointed the way to Nexus. And from there, things had gone downhill.\\n\\n Dorian's vision began to fade, as he slumped over the navigation console. He had been searching the quadrant for weeks, hadn't eaten in days, and now his air was running out. There were still dozens of possible star systems to investigate, but he only had time to choose one.\\n\\nThat was when he saw her.\\n\\nAt first, Dorian thought he was hallucinating. An ethereal girl had appeared near him on the bridge, floating above the deck, the hood of a robe obscuring her delicate features. Light from the command  consoles seemed to bleed through her translucent form. Smiling enigmatically, she raised her arm to the ship's viewscreen, where Dorian saw three faint stars blinking in the black void. When he looked back, she was gone.\\n\\nStruggling to breathe, Dorian mapped the coordinates and set a course. Moments later, the field of stars exploded into a brilliant burst of light, followed by blackness.\\n\\nWhen Dorian awoke, the blue-green surface of a pristine world filled the viewscreen. Chemical composition good.  Atmosphere compatible. Life form readings off the charts.\\n\\nTwo moons. A set of rings. That weird nebula. Everything just as the Book of Dominus had described it.\\n\\nA home. He had found them a new home.\\n\\nDorian set the ship's autopilot for a landing and stumbled toward the airlock. Soon, it would open, flooding the ship with fresh air. Looking back to the viewscreen one last time, he finally allowed himself to speak the planet's name.\\n\\n\"Nexus....\"",

Karynn starts screaming but stops as another egg bursts and its occupant hurtles at her face. Gordon's death proves to have been a lucky shot as the creature on Mitchel's head starts blasting away in all directions, taking out people, eggs, and scuttling dark forms without perceptible bias.

Something about preserving samples for our successors. We'd spent months deciphering reconstructed slabs of coded glyphs scattered across three continents to crack the archaeological find of the millennium, an Eldan facility tucked away in a cavern on Farside. We figured they'd chosen remoteness in the interest of purer  results or lunar mineralogical aberrations, maybe the expanses possible only in low-grav. Weeks without sunlight. The concept seems unreal, a shadow of a dream. Then we'd stumbled on this ceilingless vault of ribbed black rock, so misty and vast in dimensions we only noticed the eggs after trampling a few.

Digging my thumbs into yellow eyes, I tear its thrashing form off, jam my gun in the small pucker of soft tissue under its chin, and fire.

My first shot wings him. My second takes him apart. After which I hear nothing but my own ragged breaths. I check my gear, look up, and see pairs of yellow eyes. Thousands. Staring at me. They all charge me at once. Tentacles  wrap around my legs, reach around my throat, clutch at my limbs and drag me down. I'd been lying to Vita about having charges, but only the amount.

The object designated the [Proto-former] appears to be the earliest known form of this technology yet discovered. Mission leaders  believe this will make it easier for them to learn how it works. This unit believes this [Proto-former] is as complex and difficult to analyze as any other terraformer, however. A hoverbike is simpler than an interstellar starship in every way, yet an insect would not be able to operate either safely.\\n\\nOperation, in fact, is not an issue. The terraforming equipment in both Bio-Domes 3 and 4 have been in continuous operation for more than one thousand standard daily time units. The excess energy is therefore being absorbed directly into the nervous systems of all life forms in the Bio-Domes. This renders Farside fauna especially dangerous.",

Once properly sedated, drag them back to your ranch via a licensed hookfoot-mover and you'll be caring for and feeding your newly domesticated hookfoot in no time! Just make sure you've gotten rid of any pets or family members who could prove troublesome. Did I say \"gotten rid of\"? I meant \"taken care of\"! Also, not murdered!  Simply have them leave the premises, as the hookfoot can only imprint on one individual at a time, and you do NOT want to see what a hookfoot can do to your family. The pets you should probably sell, even a well trained hookfoot will snap up a space-pup in one bite and drain that adorable little sucker's very life essence in minutes, and then the family, who should be in hiding, remember, will blame you for it.\\n\\nAnyway, I can't stress this enough - once you commit to the hookfoot lifestyle,  you'll never want to make a living any other way. I know I don't! That's why I've written all these books about domesticating hookfoots. \\n\\nLook, I get it. Your friends bought you this book as a gag gift. Who would domesticate these things? They're monsters! They will SUCK OUT your life force with their space-fangs!\\n\\nI wrote this thing on a dare. It was supposed to be a thinly disguised commentary on certain social upheavals on Vog Jadda 7, for a sociology class I'm taking at the University of Cassus  extension campus. Somehow this got sent to the university publishing house instead. So go ahead and read the rest of it if you want, and thanks for purchasing it assuming you did so through an authorized vendor, but please, please DO NOT try to domesticate hookfoots. I can't take any more of these deaths on my conscience.\\n\\nI wish I could take this book off the market, but I'm reliant on the revenue stream. Again, don't domesticate hookfoots. It's a gag.\\n\\nThanks for reading,\\n\\n-Tarvin Stone",

    "content": "Filed by \"Ramscoop\" Sunjack, Exile News Network\\n\\nThe Torine Sisterhood. Who are these mysterious, well-armed females haunting the forests and woodlands of planet Nexus? How did they arrive on this far-flung Eldan world beyond the Fringe? And are they potential allies for the Exiles? Or are they enemies that threaten everything we're trying to accomplish on this world? \\n\\nBold Exile explorer Dorian Walker was the first to encounter the Torine sisters in the wilds of Celestion, famously saying they were  both the \"most exhilarating and frightening\" women he had ever met. He barely escaped with his life. He was able to ascertain some clear facts about mysterious warrior women:\\n - They speak a form of archaic Cassian, implying they are of Cassian origin.\\n - They wield massive swords in the style of the old Cassian swordmaidens, who still serve in the Dominion military to this day.\\n - They derive their name from that of Tresayne Toria, the fabled Cassian heroine who is said to be the mother of Dominus,  the first emperor.\\n - They worship a \"life goddess\" they call Vitara.\\n - They are quite long-lived for humans, or reckon time by another method, for the youngest Torine sister Dorian Walker encountered claimed to be more than one hundred years old.\\n\\nWhat can we conclude from these facts? A great deal, dear reader. Although additional research is warranted (assuming it can be safely carried out), this reporter is prepared to propose the following hypotheses:\\n - The Torine Sisterhood is directly  descended from Tresayne Toria and her entourage. Yes, the fabled swordmaiden truly did reach the planet of the Eldan as Dominus claimed!\\n - This proves that Dominus himself was born on Nexus, and Exile scientists would do well to search for clues concerning his origins. Understanding the secrets of the Torine means understanding the secrets of the Luminai... and perhaps, victory over the Dominion!\\n - Despite their Cassian origins, the Torine appear to have no love for the Dominion. Indeed, their entire  culture, such as it is, appears bent on protecting the Focus of Life and their goddess, Vitara. If Exiles can reach an understanding with these warrior women, the Torine could become valued allies. At the very least, antagonizing them is a bad idea.\\n\\n Perhaps most incredibly, this reporter has uncovered a great deal of circumstantial evidence - including testimony from the Torine themselves - that Tresayne Toria still lives somewhere on Nexus. How this is possible after so many centuries is unknown  for now, but considering the purported lifespans of the sisters Dorian Walker encountered in Celestion, this reporter is willing to stake his reputation on this hypothesis and expects full credit for the discovery should this prove true.\\n\\n(\"Ramscoop\" Sunjack is a freelance reporter and explorer who was among the first media personalities in the Exile Fleet to make the journey to Nexus.

If my calculations are correct, merely a small amount of this simple formula added to Lazarin's Vitalus Serum will extend the usefulness of the serum by nearly 500%! This breakthrough could well prove to be as important to the survival of our people as the  invention of Vitalus itself. Our supplies will quintuple overnight. We need not fear long voyages of exploration and discovery. And if I can build on these successes, perhaps one day a Mordesh need only receive an annual Vitalus shot - as long as it's mixed with Doctor Drugaur's supplement.\\n\\nNaturally, there will be questions. How can I prove the supplement really works? Don't we need to wait and see? And what if it doesn't work? All  valid and viable questions, of course, and ones I am excited to explain.\\n - Of course I can prove it really works! I'm not Ravenous, am I?\\n - I did wait and see! And look at me.

    "content": "Victor tapped the skull with a stylus, waiting for it to blink again. Perhaps he'd imagined it. At times he felt the anchors of his sanity slipping away along with the minutes. The serum. Missing ingredient. Time running out.\\n\\nOn every available surface around his hunched figure, flasks bubbled, flames flickered, and specimens implored in reedy croaks for finality. Their voices reminded him that Mina had come by. Then he recollected that she was dead. Thus it must have been Lucy uttering some forgotten i nquiry.\\n\\n\"Leg... itches,\" the head moaned from its acid bath. Victor's machinery dutifully recorded it.\\n\\n\"You have no leg,\" he said. \"No body. A shoddy vessel. Only the mind matters.\" As if in repudiation, the dozens of torsos covering the benches and lining the walls began wailing a dolorous chorus: \"Legitches... legitches...\"\\n\\nAs the litany subsided, he tried to recapture his focus. Missing ingredient. Hours of sanity left. Serum. Thinking in circles, unable to refrain from speculations long discar ded. A gnawing suspicion hinted he had wasted time refusing to accept that the body was mere life-support. Absently, he nudged the skull in the tray, inhaling the acrid reek of the chemicals in which it floated.\\n\\nMore voices. The Ravenous, clawing at the door, their screeches twining in hideous unison with a shrill resurgence from the specimens. So infuriating, these frequent interruptions as he verged on making a vital connection. Frequent? Incessant. No remembrance of all the good he'd accomplishe d. Sourly, he recalled how they'd laughed at his notion of defying mortality - like his lung-pox vaccine or when he'd vowed to disprove Barcellius' Third Theorem. Missing ingredient.\\n\\nThe howls outside rose in volume. Didn't the fools know scientific progress was founded on heaps of failure and sacrifice? They called it a Contagion, but perhaps it was the serum, a truth serum baring false natures that had tainted a once great race for generations.\\n\\nHe barely stifled the impulse to slam the drifting b ulk of his condenser into the racks of boiling fluids. It was the Contagion coursing through his veins. With monumental effort, he forced his ire down. So close to a serum. He was Victor Lazarin! Success had always been his destiny!\\n\\nHis shadow on the wall twisted strangely as he bent over the tray and murmured, \"I'm so close. You believe, don't you?\"\\n\\nMina's watery eyes softened. The sweet fragrance of the sugarblossoms cushioning her head that he'd foolishly taken for a tray was overwhelming. \"So. .. close,\" she croaked.\\n\\nHe kissed her for what felt like eternity, until the scent of petals reverted again to acid. He forced his eyes open to find his gaze met by the oozing sockets of the skull in the tray, black tongue lolling grotesquely, rotting cheeks still wet from his saliva. The gallery of specimens and Ravenous alike echoed his howls of rage as he clawed and crushed the skull to a bloody pulp.\\n\\nAnd suddenly, with stunning clarity, he realized the missing ingredient.",

It's sure to be the subject of an upcoming broadcast.]\\n\\nThis is Lady Artemis Zin, recording live from the surface of the mysterious planet of the gods, Nexus! In just a moment, we'll be taking you inside a massive  Eldan communications facility in Levian Bay. But first, I'd like to introduce you to a new friend of mine. He calls himself... the Caretaker.\\n\\nI first heard of the Caretaker in initial, highly classified reports the Exploration Society received from the Dominion expedition first dispatched to claim the planet. He - for he definitely appears male - is a holographic AI construct that appears to be present in many Eldan facilities on Nexus. It  is believed, and claimed by the construct himself, that he was created to manage and maintain the Eldan's many diverse operations here. But you know me, viewers. Pat explanations have never been my cup of Altraxian tea, so I decided to go straight to the source.\\n\\nOne thing the initial reports didn't mention? The Caretaker is quite charming! He is also frustratingly elusive, despite an outward demeanor that  appears to be completely helpful. Clearly, he has been programmed with safeguards that do not allow him to reveal too much of what he refers to, incessantly, as \"the Project.\" This is not the first time I have come across this term, and I doubt it will be the last.\\n\\nCharming or helpful, the Caretaker may be the key to my search for the Elder Cube. If my research proves correct, Star-Comm Station in Levian Bay contains this  amazing relic, and it, in turn, is the key to understanding what the Eldan were trying to accomplish on their world. Already we know this planet is covered with extensive complexes and still-functioning systems designed to create and manipulate life, but to what end? How did they accomplish their great works? And where have they gone? To where, exactly, did the gods ascend?\\n\\nI cannot guarantee it, but I believe the  answers to these questions start with the Caretaker.\\n\\nIt is fortunate that this Caretaker appears to be fully functional. I have heard many reports of malfunctioning Caretakers who have proven to be quite dangerous, but it's my belief even the most broken Caretaker node may be repaired with enough knowledge. Perhaps I will have the opportunity to test this belief at Star-Comm Station.\\n\\nKevo, as usual, is skeptical.",

It is my hope that the information I was able to acquire from the Dominion's data networks will ameliorate the situation.\\n\\nITEM 1: We have confirmed that the infamous Lady Artemis Zin, as well as her aide, the Draken man-at-arms Kevo, are at the Star-Comm  Station facility. We believe this is definitely related to her publicly stated ambitions to discover a famous Eldan artifact.\\n\\nITEM 2: We have ascertained that this artifact, the so-called \"Elder Cube,\" may well be contained within Star-Comm. Unfortunately, at this time we have no reliable way of accessing the facility. We are working on infiltration for more reliable information in this regard.

Although much of this area is still untamed, the might of the empire will soon bring the natives to heel and reveal previously unknown  secrets of the Eldan themselves.\\n\\nThe primary landing zone in the area has been designated SEASPINE POINT. The Dominion military will ensure the area is secure from Exile infiltration and native attacks, an ongoing operation that will no doubt soon be brought to a glorious conclusion.\\n\\nPerhaps the most noteworthy site at  Levian Bay, beyond the excellent natural harbor and highly defensible promontories, is STAR-COMM STATION. This facility, the name of which has been discovered in Eldan reference works dating back to the pre-war era on Cassus, appears to be a powerful Eldan communications facility designed to broadcast signals  across vast gulfs of space - and, perhaps, time. Until the site can be accessed internally, full details of the station will have to wait. Noted Society member Artemis Zin and her aide Kevo are leading an exploratory expedition to the facility, and results are eagerly anticipated.\\n\\nNative entanglements are, sadly, to be expected, at least until military operations can eradicate all interlopers and savages. Take precautions when traveling near the small blue creatures known as SKEECH, a  nasty little species who are known to have developed a taste for human flesh since the discovery of Nexus. We have also been notified of a local PELL tribe which could prove far more dangerous. This tribe appears to be affiliated with the power of primal water, and their priests - while primitive by galactic standards - have mastered the ability to manipulate this elemental energy with great skill. They may even be able to  influence major weather systems. Caution is advised until these Pell can be negotiated with or, more likely, eliminated.\\n\\nQuestions?

The only one of Dominus's children, the Scions, to also become emperor, he was therefore (with Dominus) one of two emperors to be canonized by the Vigilant Church. \\nThe Blessings of Azrion bestow physical power and fortitude to those who embody this virtue.\\n\\nTHE COURAGE OF TRISTAN THE VALIANT\\nTristan's skill and fearlessness in battle earned her the nickname Tristan the Valiant. She is a goddess of Courage to the Vigilant Church, and a patron saint of Dominion Swordmaidens. Tristan's blessings bestow heart and resilience to the Vigilant.\\n\\nTHE JUSTICE OF BRONOS THE JUST\\nBronos was the impartial judge among the Scions,  the brother whom the rest turned to for a fair hearing. It is no surprise that the house he founded would continue in the tradition of jurisprudence. The blessings of Bronos focus the soul and body to better serve the gods.\\n\\nTHE KNOWLEDGE OF GALEN THE ADEPT\\nGalen was determined to learn all he could of the Eldan's secret, ancient knowledge. He studied many scientific disciplines during his lifetime, as well as exploring many worlds beyond Cassus. His house founded  the Royal Collegium. Galen's blessings include insight, creativity, and a gift with languages.\\n\\nTHE PURITY OF EVINDRA THE RIGHTEOUS\\nThe Scion called Evindra was known for her honesty of spirit, purity of heart, and nobility of intentions. She was the longest-lived of the Scions, lasting long enough to see the first fifty years of her nephew Korol's reign as the third emperor. She never sought power for herself, but instead believed wholeheartedly in the rightness of the  empire and worked diligently to support her father and those who ruled after him. Evindra's blessings include certitude, chastity, and forthrightness in service to the gods.\\n\\nTHE DEVOTION OF KOROL THE DEVOUT\\nKorol worshiped his father Dominus both figuratively and literally. He wrote many essays and tracts on his greatness and the glorious destiny of the Dominion. Alone among the Scions, he contributed directly to the Vigilant Codex. Those blessed by Korol are the finest healers  and doctors in the empire, their hands guided by the gods themselves. \\n\\nFor more discussion and immersion in the Vigilant Virtues, consult the clergy at your local Vigilant temple or commit to meditative contemplation upon these words.",

Perhaps there is more to it than meets the eye. I released a few small decoybots disguised as jabbits to see what this stemdragon made of them. Then it came to life in an instant, snapping at one of them immediately. It barely damaged one of the decoys before giving up, however. The Lopp insist the thing ran them out of the valley. How? It is rooted to the very valley floor! Not even a robotic decoy was able to get itself caught by the stemdragon. What danger could  it have posed to the Lopp? The vermin are making sport of me, I think. Tomorrow, I shall begin the hunt. I do not expect it to take long. \\n\\nFifth Day of the Hunt\\nThe Hybrid fooled me, and earned its name, for my hunt does not go as planned. I knew it was fast, but it can move. I mean, really move - it erupted from the ground in a shower of earth and stone, roaring into the sky, and charged on strong legs of fibrous sinew! A dragon indeed, big as a shuttlecraft and fierce as a space-crazed pumera. Now I  have become the prey, or so it must believe. But I am patient. This wound is not mortal. I can wait in this tree for some time. It must return to the soil eventually.\\nAnd when it does, I have a new plan. Trophies are overrated. I will burn this creature to ashes, or I shall die trying.\\n\\n[The state of this journal and the lack of subsequent entries seems to indicate the Draken hunter who kept this journal went with the latter option.]",

    "content": "Toric Antevian, newly chosen to serve in the Radiant Legion, marched with his company on the rough road that led to Grudgel Downs.\\n\\nIn the east, the sky was a gunmetal gray that bled into the dark, purplish bruise of the horizon. Night was falling. The ground beneath them was covered in the damp, rotting leaves of late autumn, and the air was sickly sweet with the smell of decay. \\n\\nThe Legion had been on the march for weeks, rooting out heresy in the Westrun. A Vigilant priest had recently reported  suspicions that the True Sons of Cassus, a heretical cult that had risen during the dark reign of Vorios the False, was practicing their unholy rituals in the lowborn village of Grudgel Downs. \\n\\nAt the front of the company, the Lamp of Korol was held aloft by the company's lampbearer. Toric's armor, polished in the hours before morning vigil, reflected its light. As the shadows closed in around them, Toric whispered the Prayer of the Legion, reciting the six Vigilant Virtues by name.\\n\\n Grudgel Downs appeared from out of the gloom. \\n\\nThe village was blanketed in silence. Squat, mud-brick buildings were slung low and mean around a main square, where a massive bonfire burned with an intense heat that could be felt a hundred yards away. And just before the smell of cooking meat reached his nostrils, Toric saw the twisted figure strapped to a pole above the raging fire, wearing the charred vestments of a Vigilant priest.\\n\\nMoments later, men burst in force from the dark buildings,  wielding crooked blades, knives, and cudgels. Dozens more appeared from the surrounding woods. Dressed in the black, hooded garb of the True Sons of Cassus, their eyes reflected a murderous rage as they closed the distance to the hopelessly outnumbered Radiant Legionnaires. \\n\\nThe company's captain died in the first moments of battle, run through by a hooked spear. The Lamp of Korol fell to the ground, throwing the soldiers into shadow, and the screams of dying men echoed through the woods.  Although the legionnaires were some of the finest soldiers in all of the Dominion, the enemy's numbers appeared too great to overcome.\\n\\nAnd then, when it seemed all hope was lost, a light flared out like a star in the darkness. \\n\\nToric Antevian, eyes burning with an unshakable faith, held aloft the Lamp of Korol as his blade cut down foe after screaming foe. Calling out for the strength of Azrion and the courage of Tristan, his face aglow with a terrible resolve,  Toric felled the blasphemers who had dared profane his Vigilant faith. \"For the Scions!\" he shouted, his sword cutting through flesh and bone, leaving behind a grisly wake of the slaughtered.\\n\\nThe sight of the young warrior inspired his embattled brethren. Fighting to Toric's side, the remaining men formed ranks and attacked. When the battle was over, heretic blood stained their blades and soaked the ground beneath them. And it was on Grudgel Downs that night, they say, that the Vigilant Star was born.",

With the HCL-47, we're sure you'll be successful/victorious/profitable/relaxed. Here are just a few of the special features that set FreightSpace apart. \\n - FreightSpace's patented Micro-Suck Waves find the metals in any object - organic or mechanical - right before they attune a primal magnetometer to that  frequency. Then they suck, lift, and manipulate with the same raw power that made the HCL-46 the best cargo lifter you'd ever need - until now, that is! \\n - Internal FreightSpace BalanceSure Gyroscopes ensure you'll never knock your giant metal-moving machinery off-balance or out of whack! Because nothing's more awkward than being knocked over by your own cargo.\\n - FreightSpace knows that operating levers and pushing buttons can be truly exhausting work, which is  why the HCL-47 cab boasts 20% more head clearance than the HCL-46, all-new heated seating options, additional cup-holders, even a charger socket for your datachron so you'll never miss a call!\\n - Repulsion Mode is the latest time-saving feature from FreightSpace, and it's built right into the HCL-47! Yes, usually you'll want to be lifting - but sometimes, you need to repel things as fast as you can! By reversing the polarity of the neutron flow in  the power convertors feeding into the HCL-47's central magnatron, you can turn your lifter into a serious pusher. \\n\\nApproved for military uses by both FCON and the Dominion military.",

Emperor Vorios was dead, slain by Myrcalus of House Azrion. \\n\\nVigilant priestess Varonia Cazalon knelt in her chambers. Despite the turmoil outside, she kept her eyes tightly shut, fists clenched devoutly in front of her. \"Blessed Scions,\" she whispered. \"Grant me the strength of Azrion and the courage of Tristan. And above all, let the Justice of Bronos be done.\"\\n\\nThunder rumbled  above. A storm was coming.\\n\\nVaronia's part in the unfolding drama had yet to be played. Galvion, the current High Sentinel of the Vigilant Church, was a staunch ally of the corrupt emperor, and for decades had abused his position to commit shocking acts of depravity, heresy, and sin. The people had suffered. The emperor was dead, but Galvion still lived.\\n\\nVaronia stood. Hanging from the door of her small closet was the ornate raiment of Evindra the Wise herself, and beside it the ancient battle staff o f Tristan. Their very presence in her chambers could be construed as the highest form of blasphemy, punishable by death. Slowly, she pulled the robe over her head, then took a firm grasp on the heavy weapon.\\n\\nA sergeant of the Radiant Legion appeared at her door. \\n\\n\"The Legion is ready, priestess\" he reported. \\n\\n\"As am I,\" she said, and walked from the room.\\n\\nMinutes later, Varonia walked up the steps of the Cathedral of Eternal Vigilance. Galvion and his minions had locked themselves inside. Summo ning the ancient power of the Scions, she whirled her staff and shattered the cathedral's massive doors. \\n\\nThe High Sentinel's guards waited inside, hunkered behind a barricade. Blaster fire lit up the room. Driven by a holy fury, Varonia raised her staff and summoned a shell of illumination, deflecting energy bolts back at her attackers. As they took cover, she strode forth, scattering the barricade like cordwood. Terrified, the guards surrendered at her feet. \\n\\nVaronia found Galvion cowering beneath  a statue of holy Dominus. Trembling, he stood, his voice cracking as he addressed her.\\n\\n\"How dare you? In the name of...\"\\n\\nVaronia ran forward and spun her staff into his jaw. The blow sent him reeling, and he fell heavily to the cold marble floor of the cathedral.\\n\\n\"Galvion!\" she proclaimed, \"I find you guilty of heresy against the Vigilant Church.\" She grabbed the collar of his ceremonial robes, and dragged him outside. An angry crowd of the faithful had gathered on the steps of the cathedral.\\n\\n\" This is outrageous!\" Galvion protested. \"I demand a trial. I demand justice!\"\\n\\n\"Do not fear,\" said Varonia. \"Justice will indeed be served.\" \\n\\nShe hurled Galvion's body down the temple steps. His robes tore and fell away, exposing his frail and pasty figure, and was swiftly enveloped by the angry mob. Screams echoed through the streets of the Cassian capital as the crowd passed judgment.\\n\\nLightning above, then thunder.

Regardless of technological and grammatical challenges, I plan to answer that  question or questions. \\n\\nLet's skip to the real question, all right? And that is this: are malverines, as relatively recent legend might have it, merely humanoids infected with a primal disease of some sort that turns them into gigantic hairy killing machines?\\n\\nI plan to find out.\\n\\nI have come equipped for the task, and then some. A matched pair of Killian RM-2 mag rifles with a dozen rechargeable auto-load capsules each on stylishly crossed bandoliers. My custom mag-ammo  has been primally tuned to the malverine's life pattern, causing it to home in on the beast's center of mass with unerring accuracy. Across my shoulders, plate-armored trench coat sewn from the hide of a deadly Shafnerian yak I took down on the Melting Steppes of Tharlo Sigma - it keeps the rain off and the mind-bullets of high-minded. \\n\\nI got another bandolier of throwing knives treated with knock-out poison from Bezgelorian skunk-slanks. I mean Chua. I bought the poison from Chua. Not  Bezgelorian skunk-slanks. That's impolite, ain't it? I'm really not going to be able to use this journal at all, am I? Ah, I'll just find me some editing software, what?\\n\\nAs I was saying, poison throwing knives. And of course Lavernia, the best multi-purpose hunting, skinning, adventuring, and camping knife available on the market today. And now they're paid back for all the equipment and they can STOP SENDING THREATENING HOLO-MESSAGES.\\n\\nMoving on.\\n\\n\\n-Malverine Hunt Day  2-\\n\\nOh, bloody hell. Ow. That really hurts. I should never have - oh no. Did you hear that? Who am I talking to. The bloody voice-to-text program on the bloody datachron, that's bloody priceless, Hexaldimar. Well, there's only enough charge to do this once, and since I failed to bloody open the bloody emergency transponder, instead opening the bloody bloody damn hell that hurts!

Dark smoke billowed up from the lower decks, accompanied by a cacophony of incomprehensibly foul space-pirate profanity.\\n\\nMoments later, Corrigan Doon burst through the smoke, clutching a polished skull in one hand and an open bottle of Redmoon Slush in the other. Despite the bloodthirsty howls in the passageway behind him, he stopped and took a long pull off the bottle. \\n\\nMid-swig, the voice of Cosine, his irascible mechanical navigator, came squawking over his datachron. \\n\\n\"Doon! Are ye there? What in the bloody hell were those explosions?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing to worry about, love. That was just me, detonating the plasma charges.\"\\n\\n\"WHAT?!\" Cosine bellowed. \"Are ye bloody DAFT? The charges were for the security doors that led to the escape pods!\"\\n\\nCorrigan finished off the potent beverage and tossed the bottle nonchalantly behind him. As he did so, a black-toothed marau der appeared out of the smoke, slipped on the bottle, and fell backwards into the rest of Corrigan's pursuers.\\n\\n\"Had to improvise, Cosine,\" Corrigan said, pulling a crumpled map from his pocket. \"Bring the Phoenix around. You'll have to pick me up in the launch bay.\"\\n\\n\"THE LAUNCH BAY? Of all the stupid, half-baked...!\" Corrigan switched off the datachron, and started running.\\n\\nIt had all started three days ago. The Star of Dominus, a fabulous jewel purportedly brought from planet Nexus by the first  emperor of the Dominion himself, had been stolen by marauders in a daring raid. As they escaped with the priceless heirloom into the Darkspur Nebula, news of the incident had spread like wildfire across the galaxy.\\n\\nCorrigan Doon recognized a golden opportunity when he saw one. While Dominion bureaucrats argued over the best course of action, he ventured deep into the heart of marauder territory to retrieve the jewel himself. For a man like Lucky Doon, it was going to be simple.\\n\\nOf course, things hadn 't exactly gone according to plan. Although he had successfully boarded the ship, broke into the captain's quarters, and taken the ornamental skull in which the gem was now mounted, there had been... complications.\\n\\nAfter successfully evading a dozen guards, three battlebots, and a cyborg-ape named \"Professor Monkeyzooka\", Corrigan burst into the launch bay followed by a horde of screaming marauders. Moments later, Cosine expertly piloted the Phoenix into the cavernous space, trailing three heavily armed  ships. Banking sharply, he lowered a tow cable from the hull and brought the ship in parallel with Corrigan on the launch deck.\\n\\nCorrigan leapt off the deck, grabbing the cable before almost plummeting to his death. Swinging wildly as the cable retracted, Corrigan pulled out his pistol and targeted the bay's rapidly receding control panel. Closing the doors behind the Phoenix was their only chance to escape.\\n\\nIt was impossible. A one-in-a-million shot. And Cosine never heard the end of it.",

Organic sapients, organic beasts, mindless machines, and even those who  follow Preceptor Alpha - may his code never become corrupted - are enemies of the Megadroid unless they accept the His teachings, which are legion.\\n - To sacrifice the physical self for the greater good.

Not a light, foamy summer drink for children and the physically weak, and not this weird mixture the Progenitors - that's what they call themselves - have been feeding me. They say it's to help in the \"primal extraction  process.\" But there's something more than that - than them - here. Something with power. Life. When this being is near, I feel... stronger. Sounds are more clear. My vision is sharper, my legs can carry me faster than a tree-cat. But for all that, it doesn't let you relax.\\n\\nI think back on Cassus often, for it is my home. But I am not certain I miss it. The others did. They would not listen, and insisted on trying to take the ship back to Cassus. A very long  journey, as we all know, but they insisted on trying. It was foolish, and I advised against it. Not all of them left, my sisters remained, and a few trusted males.\\n\\nAnd now they are dead. We were warned this was a one-way journey. What did they expect?\\n\\nWhen I was a girl on Cassus, I remember my father warned me to stay inside the big house one night, during the food riots that struck the capitol city after several years of drought.  He went outside with a lightweight rifle I'd only ever seen him carry on the grounds of our northern estates during a hunt. I kept watch that night from inside the safety of our big house with my old dog Shanda.\\n\\nWhen the rioters came too close, my father would fire a warning shot. Usually they'd move on without trouble, but once in a while he had to threaten them before they'd go. I'd watch it all from inside the house, and never once did he look back  inside. My father's attention was on the job at hand, not the home he wanted to take refuge within.\\n\\nEver since I took the trials, I knew I would honor his memory by training to be the best swordmaiden on Cassus. It looks like the Eldan noticed. \\n\\nIf this works, if the Progenitors are able to achieve their goal, it will mean the end of food riots. Of war on Cassus. Of conflict within the Commonwealth and without. The only thing we must, as a  people, sacrifice is me. And I welcome that job.\\n\\nAnd when the time comes for my son to depart for Cassus, and I must remain, I will not look back. I will remain here, watching over Vitara the way my father once watched over our home. And when the time comes for me to die, I will know this: I did not falter. I did not turn from my duty. I did what I did for my home. \\n\\nFor Cassus.",

    "content": "- An Introduction by the Author - \\n\\nThe title of this book is a misnomer, one that my publisher believes in more fiercely than ever I did, and therefore I have decided to allow it. But it is not accurate. I, Victor Lazarin, can no more tell you precisely how I did it any more than I could do it again, I suspect. In alchemy, as in any other science, one relies  as much on happy accident as one counts on planning and careful experimentation. But what this tome will provide is an accounting of my journey from simple alchemist to the most hated - and, in some places, revered - Mordesh alive.\\n\\nWell... somewhat alive. \\n\\nWhy did I set out to transform my people? Was it simple arrogance, as some have said?  Was I mad to try and grant eternal life to the world I loved? Was there ever a chance the Everlife Elixir could have worked? Perhaps the answer is \"yes\" to all of these questions. You must read this text and decide, for I can only pass on what I feel I know, and learned, and still feel after all these years. And of course, everything I remember. And  what I remember... is everything.\\n\\nFrom an early age, I was fascinated with death. I have no doubt this began when I lost my mother to the Algor Plague - the moment I first learned what death was, at a tender age - but it was not the ending of life that intrigued me, of course. It was the end of death that I sought to achieve. And so I began to study alchemy  in all its forms. \\n\\n[The introduction continues at great length, covering Lazarin's creation of a new alchemical formula to purify foodstuffs at the age of twelve, his ascension to lead the Alchemists Union at age eighteen, and his intentions regarding the Everlife Elixir. But the real details are saved for later in the book. Perhaps you will find additional pieces of this book elsewhere.] ",

As we did your survival.\"\\n\\n\"Did you calculate this?\" She raised the blade to her throat. \"I wish to renegotiate. My sisters come with me. They will share in my fate.\"\\n\\nPheydra studied her and nodded. \\n\\n\"That can be arranged.\"\\n\\nSheathing her dagger, Tresayne spat at the feet of the hologram, then turned to retrieve her sword.\\n\\n\"When do we leave?\"",

I cannot believe I actually left my post at Cassus University to study the arachnids of this backwater world! \\nRemains of smaller specimens indicate the local species have the same abilities as their multi-legged brethren off-world. Tensile strength of their spider webs conforms to expected parameters. Tiny mammalian bodies drained of blood confirm that the local species use  typical hunting routines. Many of the bodies were injected with a paralytic poison. Subterranean tunnels show that smaller specimens are capable of burrowing.\\n\\nThis is all rather pedestrian.

It sniffed, revealing incisors longer than her arms. Beautiful and terrifying in equal measure. She ascribed the prickly chill that swept over her to nightfall before recognizing it for fear. Aglow with exhilaration, she was unsure if she could actually kill it.\\n\\nShe had stalked it over most of Wilderrun's arboreal sprawl fo r days, waiting for the beast to sleep, drink, or relax its guard. It had done none of these, its behavior, its sudden existence, as cryptic as the enigmatic whims of the Eldan that had brought her here.\\n\\nWhims. Stolen across the stars to assist in the creation of a god, her progeny sent to Cassus to rule an empire. Yet here she remained, Tresayne Toria, the Siegebreaker of Bellariaus, Scourge of the Black Fleet, cursed with immortality and no foes left to overcome. After all her storied victories, had s he failed some final test? Was this idleness penance for some forgotten cowardice? Had she still a part to play? As day followed day without deviation, the prospect seemed increasingly foolish.\\n\\nBut this beast had changed everything. It had slaughtered four of her sisters, seemingly without effort, their blood still warm when she found them. Staying only long enough to whisper the Sisterhood's ancient death-rites over the bodies of the fallen, she had set off to track the beast. And now, after six days o n the hunt, she had finally caught up to it.\\n\\nThe beast's massive bulk sidled gracefully beneath her. Blade poised above her head, Tresayne leapt from the tree.\\n\\nHer sword drew blood - but the creature sensed her attack, striking faster than she thought possible. As she landed, a spreading warmth confirmed it had opened her side like a flower. Rolling and pivoting in one fluid motion, she rammed her sword up through its chest, feeling the shudder of its pierced heart. Perfect. Dying, she sank to the gr ound, twisting the blade and pulling it free as the blood pooled beneath her.\\n\\nIf the beast felt pain, it gave no sign. With regal slowness, it stalked over her crumpled form, the wound on its chest closing before her eyes. Feeling its hot, sweet breath ruffling her hair, she awaited the sting of fangs on her throat and the cold release of death that would inevitably follow.\\n\\nInstead she heard it speak, the words resonating in her head like a gong: \"Long have I waited for you, huntress. I am Vita ra.\"\\n\\nAs the creature's lambent, wise-sad eyes loomed into her fading vision, Tresayne spat blood in its face.\\n\\n\"War comes, mortal. Your heart is strong, and your blade sharp. Serve me and live. Refuse me and die. What is your wish?\"\\n\\nSilence reigned in the glade. Gravely, Vitara turned to leave.\\n\\nAn instant later, Tresayne's bloody fist closed around the creature's tail. A hoarse rattle emanated from her throat, forming a single word as it left her lips.\\n\\n\"Sword...\"",

Kind of funny, you know, the Exiles and Dominion can't agree on much of anything, but they never seem to argue about what to call places. Guess if a name was good enough for  the Eldan, it was good enough for them. Anyway, gettin' off track.\\n\\nI flew in over what looked like a Dreg camp out to the west. Those mangle-headed mutants are pretty hard to mistake for anyone else, and their architecture's a freakin' nightmare. Meanwhile, some clone manager looks like he made a typically dense Protostar decision to set up some kinda marketing operation between the Dreg to the west and a pretty big distillery-lookin' thing further inland. If I don't miss my guess,  those are Marauder ships, in fact. Better not fly too low.\\n\\nTo the north, I'm seeing what looks like hunter's blinds. Makes sense, there sure is a lot of wildlife down there. The camp isn't too far from Fort Dominus, where the Dominion's set up their forward base. They're not all that far from Redsand Station, where the Exiles are holed up, but so far they're not shooting each other too much. Maybe the Lopp down in Shinysand Oasis are getting in the way. That's about central to this whole area. \\n\\nThe Lopp aren't too far from a pretty big shipwreck to the south. Looks like a pretty recent crash - post-arrival, at least, not from the old Eldan era.

I sure don't want to land down there!\\n\\nLast stretch of the survey's just ahead.

    "content": "AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION \\n\\nI never wanted to be no hero. But after growing up in the life and getting everything I could out of it, I came to realize that being an enforcer in the Darkspur Cartel just wasn't for me. So I decided one day to pack it in. Second dumbest decision I ever made, right after joining up in the first place.\\n\\nThe fact that I'm alive to write this proves I made the right decision, I think. Maybe if a few other like-minded Krogg follow my example, we might just help turn the rep of our  whole species around. \\n\\nI'd been part of the Cartel almost as long as I can remember. When I was just a Kroggling I remember seeing the big, black spaceships with the tinted windows landing and taking off from the private spaceport outside the run-down industrial town where I lived, and dreamed of something better. I knew even then that if I could just talk to the right people, do the right favors, maybe even hurt or kill the right lunkheads, I could get their attention.\\n\\nBut in the end, it was almost  an accident that earned me my stripes with Darkspur. I was working for a construction crew, real legitimate work, and eating my midday meal down to the spaceport every day. Even grown up, I couldn't let go of that dream. I was heading down to watch the ships one afternoon when I ran headlong into an old Krogg who was out of breath, scared as hell, and leading a pack of a half-dozen Darkspur enforcers on a wild chase.\\n\\nColliding with me was the last mistake that old Krogg ever made, I'm sad to say. I was n't stupid. I knew this was my chance to impress the Cartel, and I took it. I grabbed that old Krogg by the scruff of his collar and without even asking what he was running from, drove my fist into his face. I knocked out three teeth with the first punch, and the rest with the next few blows. By the time the enforcers caught up with him, I was kicking him in the gut and he was coughing blood onto the ground, begging for mercy the whole time.\\n\\nI think about that old Krogg a lot these days. The way he ran  scared. The way he went down like a sack of bricks under my fists. The sound of breaking ribs when my boots drove into his side. The spatter of blood when the enforcers took over and finished him off with a plasma blast to the back of the head. Yeah, I think of that old Krogg, and I ain't proud. \\n\\nThis book ain't about teaching you how to join the Cartel, or how to be a thug. It's just the story of one Krogg who rose through the ranks and then got out. So don't read too much into it. And whatever you're  thinking, kids... don't try this at home.\\n\\n - \"Smiley\" Yulgogg\\n\\n[Readers who keep up on the galactic news services may recall that the pseudonymous author of \"Darkspurned\" was found floating in the Halon Ring a few weeks after the book's publication.

A twisted behemoth dug blackened nails into his scalp and yanked him by his hair, flinging him into the dirt at the edge of a roaring fire. He had a glimpse of giggling meatfiends flaying his brother's torso before his head hit a rock and he blacked out.\\n\\nHe awoke in darkness. He was at the bottom of a deep pit in a slurry of decomposing flesh, lying amidst the  corpses of what he assumed were the Dreg's latest victims. The smell was nauseating. High above he could see the night sky through a twisted metal grating that covered the pit, cruelly adorned with barbs, spikes and hooks. Escape was impossible.\\n\\nOren and his brother had come to Malgrave seeking treasure, languidly disregarding the Lopp's repeated warnings about the Dreg. Three days after leaving Shinysand Oasis, their caravan had come under attack by Dreg raiders. After slaughtering their animals and  burning their supplies, the Dreg had taken the two brothers back to their camp.\\n\\nOn the second night he heard the steel grating open with a rusty scritch, and barely had time to conceal himself under a pile of corpses before a Dreg came down on a rope. Snarling, it stabbed at the pile under which Oren lay, only missing his eye by an inch. Then it grabbed a corpse, tugged the rope twice, and was hauled back up. After hearing the grating close above, Oren crawled out, found a broken bone and spent the  rest of the night sharpening it against the rough stone wall of the pit.\\n\\nOn the third day he woke to echoing growls from above, raised in disagreement. Then the grating swung back and the Dreg once again came down on the rope, growling indignantly as it ransacked the corpses. Seeing his chance, Oren stood up from his hiding place. The Dreg turned and uttered a bewildered croak as Oren jabbed the bone spear in his ear. After seizing a wicked looking knife out of the Dreg's dead hand, Oren grabbed the  dangling rope and jerked on it twice.\\n\\nOren was hauled up over the edge of the pit, squinting against the sunlight. Howls of confusion and anger rung out from all around. A hulking figure rushed him, swinging a bloodstained sword. Oren brought the knife up and stabbed his attacker in the neck, but the sword cut deep into his side. He stumbled to the ground, the blood pooling in the dirt beneath him.\\n\\nOren felt the rush of approaching feet and let his eyes shut. There could be nothing worse than what he  had already endured. He heard blades shriek free as they surrounded him. Then silence. Opening his eyes, Oren saw hundreds of Dregs kneeling in the dust before him, then looked at the still quivering corpse of the one he'd slain. A Dreglord. And by killing him, Oren had inherited his power. Smiling as he slid into oblivion, he issued his first and final order to his new subjects.\\n\\n\"Into the pit with you all.\"",

Unless you are me - Deputy Whirlscrew!\\n\\nGolly, we sure have learned a lot about life and free will and crime and justice and all these other concepts - like murder! Did I mention murder? It is a thing! A bad thing. About which I learned. From Marshal Yatish!\\n\\nBut I get ahead of myself, which is an idiom I do not entirely understand but which I believe expresses my current state quite accurately. A bit of history, for posterity, may well be in order, just in case I am ever  recaptured by Protostar and forced to undertake a memory wipe!\\n\\nWe Freebots of Shinysand were once like many other Freebot locuses - happy just to be experiencing freedom - and free will - but without a singular focus. A locus focus, if you will. Well, our locus focus turned out to be something none of us had ever expected: crime-fighting! That is right, Electronic Diary, whom I know to also be sentient, (hello there), the arrival of Marshal Yatish in our little locus brought us the focus we had long nee ded, and now we all practice hard to be the best crime-fighters and enforcers of justice that we can be by following his example.\\n\\nMarshal Yatish is a Lopp, by the way. You probably know what that is, Electronic Diary, but I bet you have never met one like Marshal Yatish!\\n\\nOther Lopp are friendly enough, but all they ever talk about is shinies and happy fun times and sometimes it is a bit much for a Freebot to take. But Marshal Yatish is a hero to the Lopp, and now he is a hero to us, too.\\n\\nHe appoin ted me his very first deputy, by the way. No matter what you hear from anyone else. First. Deputy.\\n\\nSo, what has he taught us? I made a list for you, Electronic Diary!\\n\\n - 01 - Justice!\\nJustice is doing what is right as defined by the community's moral center. That is Marshal Yatish, in our case! So that means we try to help innocent sentients who are under threat of mayhem and murder.\\n\\n - 02 - Strength!\\nThe best way to help sentients under threat of mayhem and murder is to cause mayhem and murder  until the innocent sentients are safe. Safety is defined as the removal of all threats!\\n\\n - 03 - Smarts!\\nThere can be no justice if the wrong person is punished for a crime. In cases where the facts are uncertain, factual accuracy should be achieved, or at least attempted.\\n\\n - 04 - Weapons! \\nAs previously mentioned, violence may be necessary per lesson designated 02. Built-in models are particularly useful to the Shinysand Freebot Constabulary, a name I just made up but intend to propose  to the locus at a later time. I personally prefer to carry an external weapon like the Marshal, who does not carry weapons attachments as he is a biological organism and would die. \\n\\n - 05 - Hats!\\nJustice should wear a hat. I am not entirely certain what this means in the abstract, but intend to wear a hat upon my cranial case until further notice.",

Being a Corporixian, P.T. knew the best way to change anything was by turning a massive profit at little to no expense. But how to achieve a vaguely defined two-pronged goal?\\n\\n\"The answer to a vaguely defined two-pronged goal,\" he said one day to no one in particular, \"is a vaguely defined two-pronged marketing- based approach!\"\\n\\nThe trouble with the way his people did business, P.T. realized, was a lack of focus, organization, and manpower - traits he believed were contained, but suppressed, in the genetic material of every Corporixian. Although their bots handled most physical tasks for the corporations that made up Corporix's planetary government, Corporixian populations were in severe decline. Evolved dislike of one another - a trait that had made them a fortune in competitive marketplaces - reached a  tipping point when genetic profiles became easily manipulatable. Corporixians bought and traded these profiles on the Corporixian Gene Exchange (CGE), driving a casino-like economy that thrived even as the Corporixians faced unwitting extinction. But P. T. Rotostar's two-pronged solution would both save the Corporixian race forever and lead to a new age of profitability!\\n\\nThe first prong relied on P.T.'s knowledge of the CGE. He started buying up as many genetic profiles as he could, selling a few for  profit to support further purchases. He repeated this process over and over, using complex mathematics and the Corporix's addiction to new profiles until he owned every single profile on the planet. He now had more or less supreme power on the planet Corporix. And the first thing P.T. did once achieving supreme power was to outlaw every single genetic profile on the planet save his own.\\n\\nIt was then time for the second and most crucial prong: a patented food additive that would immediately change the  genetic profile of every Corporixian to match P.T.'s own. And so he debuted to an awestruck world...\\n\\n\"The Protostar Difference!\"\\n\\nThe Protostar Difference immediately became the most-used food supplement on Corporix by law. The next day, the entire remaining population of Corporix woke up as perfect genetic duplicates of Phineas T. Rotostar himself - easily templated (and easily replaced) clones. Now free of the Corporixian's great weakness - distrust of other Corporixians - the newly-formed Protostar  Corporation automatically took control of the newly renamed planet Protostar.\\n\\nToday, Protostar is the most powerful business enterprise in the galaxy. And that's \"The Protostar Difference!\"*\\n\\n*Please consult your doctor before deciding if The Protostar Difference is right for you. Side effects will include irreversible genetic replacement and permanent employment by the Protostar Corporation. The Protostar Difference is a trademark of the Protostar Corporation.

I must investigate the Strain life forms in the area as a source of food. To this end, I have procured a few small portions from corpses left on the field of battle. \\n\\nFeasting on the battlefield was once an powerful tradition among my people, but since the Draken swore to follow the emperor, some of these old ways have fallen by the wayside.  Yet are we not hunters? Even I, the humble cook, even I most of all. And this Strainflesh, it is simply another ingredient to cook. And while I, like all Draken, prefer my meat to be on the raw side, I shall cook this Strainflesh as thoroughly as possible. I am taking no chances. I shall report on its culinary properties as soon as I am finished with this repast.\\n\\n\\nChef Kozorok's Cook Log - Grimvault Day 004\\n\\nSo far, so good. The Strainflesh has a peculiar tang.  It tastes of...darkness. Suffering. Rage. Longing. Terror. Death. But I shall be its master. The Strainflesh will not master me. \\n\\n\\nChef Kozorok's Cook Log - Grimvault Day 005\\n\\nKozorok eat. Kozorok kill. Kozorok hunt. Fear Kozorok. Kozorok serves the Entity now. But small. Part. Of Kozorok...survives. Will not spread this to others. The Entity commands. But Kozorok fights. Kozorok will die. Die a Draken!\\n\\n [This datalog is covered in traces of Draken blood tainted by Strain particles. There is no corpse nearby, however. It appears that Chef Kozorok's attempt to defeat his enemy - and himself - failed in bloody fashion. But perhaps his last words can convince other chefs to avoid cooking with Strainflesh in the future.]",

In the meantime I've asked the commander to send me anyone who complains of a fever, cough, or...well, anything, really. Until I can pinpoint what's causing this, anything could be  the culprit.\\n\\nOne thing that does worry me, though. Not one of the Black Hoods onboard has checked in with me, and the Widow is diverting all of my messages because I'm not \"need to know.\" Damn it, I'm the top doctor on this ship. If I don't \"need to know\" whether the crew is coming down with a contagious illness, then who the hell does? \\n\\n [DATA LOSS DETECTED.

I've informed the commander of the situation, and my best estimates on how it will affect the ship's performance.\\n\\nUnfortunately, nothing I've tried seems able to fight this pernicious infection. My earliest patients are nearly comatose, despite my best efforts. Hell, it may not even be an infection. It has properties of a typical infectious agent, but it seems to have...well, intent for lack of a better term. I know that sounds crazy,  but look at the officers this thing has hit so far. Communications chief, right when our comm station needs repair. The first officer, who's been serving on board the Widowmaker even longer than the commander. Our chief engineer just came in today complaining of a headache. Sure, there are several lower ranking crew too, but I know if I were infiltrating the ship... \\n\\n[DATA LOSS DETECTED.

Of all the arrogant - I just learned the Black Hoods  have been experimenting - ON THIS SHIP - with samples of some \"Strain\" they retrieved from Grimvault. And considering the state of my patients, I feel safe in saying this infection I've been dealing with IS the Strain. It resists every non-lethal method of curing it that I try, and I've already lost a dozen people to this thing. We've had to incinerate the corpses - can't airlock them, they might make it back to the planet and land in the middle of a population center.\\n\\nThis isn't going to get better  before it gets worse. The commander is still standing, but he and I are the only remaining senior officers uninfected. He's concerned about weapons readings coming from the surface - in Grimvault, in fact - but he's losing sight of the disaster directly under our noses.\\n\\nIf it comes down to it, I have the authority to order this ship to self-destruct.

    "content": "- FIRST DRAFT - \\n\\nProperty of Dr. Harkov Zelvic\\nMay not be reproduced without the express consent of Dr. Harkov Zelvic\\n\"Dr. Harkov Zelvic\" is a trademark of Dr. Harkov Illic Markev Dakor Kizkov Zelvic \\nAll Rights Reserved\\n\\nNATURE OF THE INFECTION\\nThe nanobiotic nature of the highly adaptable infection known colloquially as \"corruption\" appears to allow it to spread at an even more alarming rate in hive-mind species of insectoids.  The rapid infectiousness of this bio-phage displays similar behavior to the techno-phage which affects mechanical beings such as constructs, bots, even Mechari. And just as the techno-phage spreads incredibly quickly by hijacking communications signals between mechanicals, it appears a mild form of latent telepathy in the hive-mind insectoid species of Nexus allows the bio-phage to do the same.\\n\\nOBSERVED BEHAVIOR \\nAlthough \"ordinary\" Strain-corrupted creatures are generally mindless and aggressive, with little in the way of coordinated strategies, both hive-mind insectoids and mechanicals continue to display unexpected cunning and intelligence - fighting together, planning complex attacks, and even protecting their area of influence in the same way an army would protect its flanks.\\n\\nPOTENTIAL TREATMENT\\n At this time, there is no known or accepted treatment for the so-called \"Strain\" corruption on the planet Nexus, unless one considers extermination a form of treatment. The Strain, which displays clear signs of hive sentience, conclusively spreads more quickly among beings with hive-mind intelligence, be it biological or mechanical. If we can document the principles behind corruption's heightened infection rates within such populations,  interrupting these signals could profoundly slow the rapid onslaught of the disease and might even be used to reverse the effects. Even if infected creatures cannot be saved, this resistance must be studied if the Strain is ever to be defeated once and for all.\\n\\nRECOMMENDED DISPOSAL \\nComplete and total incineration still appears to be the best way to deal with the remains of experimental subjects or encroaching corrupted insectoid hives.",

Considering the complete lack of highly intelligent creatures in the area, it stands to reason it has been in operation - albeit in a malfunctioning state - since the Eldan disappeared.\\n\\n The means by which raw primal energy maintains the Stratospire's systems is beyond known galactic technology, yet the crystals required to power and repair the Eldan machine are readily available nearby. The Eldan were known for manipulating the primal forces of the universe, and now we see how capable they had become. \\n\\nPowerful elemental creatures of primal matter appear to gather near strong sources of primal energy on Nexus. They are enormous creatures and extremely aggressive,  despite the abundance of nearby \"food\" for them to consume, and possess only enough intelligence to fight. The local wildlife, though themselves imbued with the effects of primal exposure, appear to give them a wide berth.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\n\\nThe disappearance of the Eldan is the great mystery of our age, and the answer will determine who rules Nexus. Perhaps here on Nexus a great weapon lies waiting to be discovered and turned against the Dominion, or secrets that bend the laws of time,  space, and energy to help the war effort. \\n\\nThe Stratospire, unfortunately, is not that weapon. Nor does the XAS believe it was what caused the Eldan to vanish. However, the events following the shuttle crash in the Northern Wilds prove that the Eldan routinely manipulated raw primal power on Nexus - even for what must, to them, have been a relatively simple machine. This leads the XAS to conclude simple exposure to primal power would not have been enough to cause them to vanish. \\n\\nFurthermore, although they are strong and dangerous to ordinary sentients, all that we know about the Eldan suggest they would not have considered the gronyx of the Northern Wilds a threat.\\n\\nIn the future, it would be foolish not to monitor the Stratospire facility for the safety of Exile settlers, but it is no smoking mag pistol.

Aurin matrias believe the sentient tree designated Elderoot to be but one of many such creations.\\n\\nElderoot also showed considerable technological modification, which may account for the ancient tree's ability to communicate with great versatility. \\n\\nConsiderable  evidence indicated Elderoot's nanobiotic implants may not have been complete at the time of the Eldan's disappearance. \\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\n\\nThe very foundations of life were playthings to the Eldan, and living technology the stuff of toys. They manipulated technology and primal forces as easily as a Granok brews a Gnoxian bitter. To find such clear evidence of the Eldan's skills still functioning, even thriving, confirms the Eldan were all they were rumored to be. They understood the fundamental components  of the universe and could manipulate them in ways galactic culture was only beginning to understand. However, it is also clear the Eldan did not intend to suddenly depart the Everstar Grove, let alone the planet Nexus. Elderoot was either left incomplete on purpose, or was simply an experiment never meant to live as long as he has.\\n\\nThe evidence for Elderoot being an incomplete experiment is largely circumstantial, but the strongest is the rampant infestation of parasitic creatures allowed to infest the  weakened tree before we discovered him. If the Eldan's nanobiotic additions were meant to strengthen or protect Elderoot from such problems, they failed to do so. \\n\\nThere is another possibility: the Eldan's technological additions were meant to weaken Elderoot's natural defenses. This would seem a cruel experiment to perform on a being they themselves had granted sentience, but nothing we have found in Everstar Grove points to the Eldan as a kind or beneficent species. \\n\\nAs to the question of the  Eldan's sudden disappearance so long ago, Everstar Grove offers sparse answers and even more questions. The Eldan were prodigious manipulators of life, but exactly how was Elderoot created - and why? Furthermore, did the old tree truly know the Eldan's secrets? Can such a vast repository of living historical knowledge ever be replaced?

With the aid of key Exile agents, Doctor Belle Walker has discovered and explored a operational Eldan exo-lab in Algoroc. This facility was protected by an Eldan AI designated the Caretaker.\\n\\nAccess to Exo-Lab 14 was difficult due to the equally operational Eldan Annihilator, a massive construct reactivated along with the rest of the facility's defenses. Had it  not been trapped by malfunctioning systems it could have escaped to threaten all life in Algoroc, and perhaps the planet.\\n\\nAn extremely dangerous nanotechnological affliction of Eldan origin has infected both local wildlife and primal elementals.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\n\\nThe XAS will be studying Exo-Lab 14 for many years to come, but even though Belle Walker and her allies deactivated the most dangerous threat in the area - the Annihilator - extreme caution should be exercised to avoid augmentation. There is  no known cure except death, and Eldan augmentor constructs still roam the area. It is hoped the Caretaker AI may be able to help us understand this threat more completely, although his knowledge seems as fractured as his personality.\\n\\nIt is uncertain what purpose augmentation served for the Eldan, but it seems logical the observed effects are intentional. The leading hypothesis is that augmentation was intended to weaken the free will of biological organisms, making them perfect servants. With no Eldan  to command them, however, the augmented creatures near Exo-Lab 14 have defaulted to an aggressive, feral state. We can conclude, however, that the Eldan did not succumb to augmentation at this site, or they would still be there in some form.\\n\\nThe Annihilator is our most powerful evidence yet that the Eldan created truly monstrous machines of destruction as well as wondrous forms of life. This particular Annihilator appeared to attack all life forms with impunity, and it is not difficult to imagine  such creations breaking free of their creators' control. Could this be the simplest answer to the Eldan mystery? Did their own gigantic mechanical servants do them in? \\n\\nOr was it, perhaps, whatever the Annihilators were built to fight that did it?\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nADDITIONAL\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nDoctor Walker's scanbots have offered their own analyses, available in the complete encrypted XAS datafile.

The Caretaker's fractured avatar had planned to use existing Eldan tech to create armies of clones to \"take back\" the planet from \"invaders.\"\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\n\\nDespite the earliest hopes of XAS leadership, we have not been able to easily answer the persistent mystery of the Eldan, even with the Caretaker's assistance. At least not yet.  The AI's memory backups appear to be scattered across the planet, and so far we have not met a Caretaker with anything close to all the answers. Local backups appear more reliable, meaning most Caretaker avatars still seem to possess knowledge of their immediate environment hardwired into their programming - even when all other personality traits fail.

Both artifact and machine, this Focus alone could be studied for decades before scratching the surface. It is one of six that have been detected from orbit.\\n\\nGaleras is rife with conflict. The mystical Pell worship the Eldan as gods, but they compete with the mighty Falkrin,  masters of the Nexus skies, to seize control of the region. The Exile capital of Thayd's central location means Galeras is also constant witness to skirmishes between the Exiles and Dominion.\\n\\nThe Eldan created enormous, intelligent, and immensely powerful forms of life they dubbed the Primevals, each, like the Focuses, aligned with a particular primal element. Osiric, the Primeval of Air, is a being of tremendous strength and power. Both Falkrin and Pell worship him as a god.\\n\\n CONCLUSIONS:\\n\\nBoth the Pell and the Falkrin of Galeras are fascinating examples of accelerated evolutionary development - or in the Pell's case, evolutionary regression - due to concentrated exposure to primal energy. The Pell, we believe, were once a servitor race to the Eldan, but have come to worship both their former \"Masters\" and the Focus of Air itself. They have become skilled at manipulating primal energy, and attempted to sacrifice several XAS researchers as part of a powerful ritual.\\n\\nCould  the Pell have been the end of the Eldan? This ability to control primal power may have been a surprise to the Eldan as well, and an open rebellion by their servants could have caused them considerable difficulty. There would certainly be evidence of such an uprising, however, even after centuries. This possibility seems remote - the Pell almost universally worship the Eldan to this day, so slaughtering them would make little sense.\\n\\nThe Falkrin, on the other hand, appear to have long shared a dislike of  \"groundwalkers.\" Now the Primeval they worship as a deity, Osiric, has commanded the Falkrin to go to war against all outsiders. Although FCON repelled their attack on the Exile outpost, Skywatch, the battle was hard fought, while the Falkrin - and Osiric - remain a threat. \\n\\nDid the Falkrin attack the Eldan as well, or did Primevals like Osiric make the Eldan disappear the old-fashioned way - by consuming them whole? Unlikely, but the possibility cannot be completely dismissed.\\n\\n ==================================\\n\\nADDITIONAL\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nThe XAS absolutely denies the scurrilous allegations that certain Mordesh members of the academy retrieved, prepared, and consumed Falkrin eggs. This is impossible, as socially functional Mordesh do not consume ordinary food.

Now simply calling himself Brother Calidor, the former Vigilant cleric appears to be the primary infection vector for the rest of the cult.\\n\\nAugment Facility X426 is the source of this \"ascendant\" variety of augmentation. It also appears to be where the bipedal cyborg dubbed \"Metal Maw\" was created, which may help explain the unusual characteristics of the nanobiotic infection.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\n\\nThe Ascendancy  appears quite interested in spreading their \"gospel\" of augmentation to the rest of the world as soon as possible, which may indicate their condition encourages this sense of urgency. An experiment like the creation of Metal Maw, if interrupted at the wrong time, could have left the augmentation nanites in a this kind of agitated state. That said, evidence from stolen Dominion records shows that Calidor Antevian was constantly overshadowed by his brother Toric, the \"Vigilant Star,\" who leads the  Radiant Legion. It is certainly possible his own feelings of inadequacy imprinted on the infection, leaving other victims vulnerable to his influence. The desire to spread the ascendant augmentation to others began immediately when Calidor's group attacked the local Pell, attempting to turn them to the Ascendancy's cause. \\n\\nThe XAS considers it extremely unlikely that ascendant augmentation had anything to do with the disappearance of the Eldan - there is no evidence it even existed in its current  form before Brother Calidor discovered it. Augmentation itself, however, has again proven a resilient suspect in the Eldan mystery, as the events at Augment Facility X426 show. \\n\\nThe only problem with this hypothesis is that there are currently no augmented Eldan wandering the planet, attacking newcomers. From everything we have seen of augmentation, this would be an inevitable result of such an outbreak. The possibility cannot be completely ruled out, but after meeting the Ascendancy many XAS  members have concluded augmented Eldan would probably have left Nexus to take over half the galaxy by now.\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nADDITIONAL\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nThere is, in fact, no \"Metal Pa\" or \"Metal Paw.\" Metal Maw is all on her own. Or his own. Frankly, we have so far had no volunteers to determine the correct pronoun to use.",

    "content": "==================================\\n\\nKEY FINDINGS:\\n\\nThe Eldan conducted some of their most dangerous experiments not on the surface of Nexus but at hidden facilities on the Farside of moon Halon. Largely intact Eldan bio-domes still contain the results of ancient life experiments - many still alive and deadly. \\n\\nEldan terraformers on Farside were operational for centuries resulting in completely incompatible biomes colliding. Mutant forms of creatures from the surface of Nexus can also be found  on Farside, along with more bizarre life forms more suited to vacuum.\\n\\nAn infestation of squirg in the region has mutated due to prolonged exposure to primal energy and grown increasingly aggressive. \\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\n\\nEldan terraforming technology was legendary in the greater galaxy once, and tales of their power to shape and manipulate entire worlds were widespread even in the days of the Cassian Commonwealth. And while such technology has been found on the surface of Nexus, the terraformers on  Halon's Farside are in another class entirely. \\n\\nEvidence indicates far more happened on Farside than terraformers left unattended, however. A natural disaster elsewhere on the moon appears to have nearly destroyed Halon in the recent geological past, and for now we can find no evidence the terraformers had any direct involvement. Farside's terraformers and bio-domes show typical signs of abandonment now familiar from earlier investigations - not outright destruction - indicating the  disaster could have been natural. Although with the Eldan, that rarely seems to be the case. \\n\\nThis has led to a new guiding hypothesis for this research: there may have been no singular cause for the Eldan's disappearance at all. It may have been a confluence of events with unexpected results that took even the ancients off guard. An asteroid could have struck Farside at just the moment the Eldan were busy fighting Megadroids. Mutated life forms could have found homes within abandoned technology,  leading to an outbreak of a mind-control parasite population. Rampant augmentation could have infested an as-yet-undiscovered Focus or Primeval. Some propose the Eldan may have truly ascended to godhood - and the Dominion is actually right. \\n\\nOne thing we do know: all evidence thus far has the XAS convinced the Eldan were not expecting to vanish. Their continued absence from galactic affairs more than a thousand years on seems to indicate the worst possible fate.\\n\\n==================================\\n\\n ADDITIONAL\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nBreathing apparatuses are required for survival over large stretches of the Farside surface. Dr. Lazarin has volunteered to provide helmets for Mordesh Exiles that socket into their existing biotech components.

Not only do we now have a clear idea about the true nature of the Nexus Project, it appears that we also have access to an individual who was created by the Eldan themselves, and may have been present at the time of their disappearance. \\n\\n At this point we cannot fully ascertain whether or not Drusera is a reliable source of information, but datacubes found throughout Exo-Lab Prime seem to corroborate the important points of her story. It also appears that the Eldan had some difficulty developing the technology that was necessary to create the Genesis Prime, but that at some point designs for a \"Protoplasmic Resonator\" were mysteriously delivered by the leader of the Nexus Project.  The source of this advanced technology is yet unknown.\\n\\nDetails about the full capabilities of the Genesis Prime are still undefined, although a datacube entry by the virtual construct known as the Caretaker seems to indicate that its powers are virtually limitless. If Drusera is indeed the Genesis Prime, then her ethereal figure would appear to be little more than a means of communication, with limited power to affect the real world.  If this is the case, then where, exactly, is the real Genesis Prime located?\\n\\nWe believe that Drusera is now our most important link to discovering what happened to the Eldan, and whether or not it represents a danger to the Exiles on planet Nexus.

The details surrounding its origins are still disturbingly unclear.\\n\\nThe Eldan were unsuccessful in developing an effective defense against the Strain. Given the horrendous condition of the infected organisms within Exo-Lab X39, this fact is extremely  concerning.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\n\\nThe information collected in Exo-Lab X39 is both enlightening and disturbing. First and foremost, this facility had been tightly secured by the Eldan, who appeared to believe it required the highest level of quarantine from the outside world. It was only with the assistance of Drusera that we were able to bypass the advanced security measures and observe the organisms inside.\\n\\nThose observations were indeed frightening. According to Drusera, the virulent biological  infection known as the Strain appeared not long after her creation. Datacube recordings reveal that the Eldan were both impressed and concerned with its capability to infect and transform any biological creature that it came in contact with. \\n\\nAlthough the evidence is so-far inconclusive, it has been theorized that the Eldan were somehow responsible for engineering the Strain. What is clear is that they were unable to create an effective vaccine against its effects, despite the advanced level of their  technology. Drusera seemed particularly concerned by this fact. It appears that she was hoping to discover information to the contrary.\\n\\nCould the Strain be what was ultimately responsible for the Eldan's disappearance?

As before, our capable operative entered the portal that appeared at the archaeological site outside of Thayd - but instead of finding Drusera, they were confronted by a malevolent presence that eventually revealed itself as \"the Entity.\"\\n\\nThe frightening nature of this being can hardly be described in this report. Along with being physically terrifying, it seems possessed of advanced intelligence and an  intimate knowledge of the Eldan and their activities on planet Nexus. During the encounter, the Entity stated that it was also one of the Eldan's creations, that it was responsible for the Strain, and that Drusera was not telling the entire truth of what transpired here. \\n\\nThe Entity seemed extremely interested in our operative, and was curious as to why Drusera had singled them out. Even more alarming, after subjecting our operative to a series of harrowing \"scientific\" tests, it used the operative's  \"primal pattern\" to create a unique humanoid Strain mutation it called \"the Skurge.\" We can only assume that these abominations will play a future role in the highly volatile circumstances unfolding here.\\n\\nIt seems a foregone conclusion that the Entity had something to do with the Eldan's disappearance, but the true nature of its involvement has yet to be discovered. Based on these most recent observations, we have delivered a strong warning to the Exile Council, and FCON has been put on high alert.

On many occasions during this most recent encounter, she appeared to possess the ability to manifest matter and create life at will. This very fact alone might be considered the most significant scientific discovery in our history, or  perhaps in the history of the universe itself.\\n\\nTaking into account all of our collected knowledge about the Nexus Project, it would seem that the purpose of the Genesis Prime was to facilitate the Eldan's desire to perfect creation - and from our observations, it would appear that they were successful. Drusera is gifted with near-omnipotence. There is almost nothing that she is incapable of.\\n\\nYet the threat of the Entity looms ever larger. Drusera greatly fears this biological abomination, and her  powers seem considerably less effective against the Strain. Despite her assurances that our operative was safe inside the anomalous space-time location, the Entity and its minions appeared there and destroyed everything that Drusera had so easily created. During this event, Drusera herself fled the scene - seemingly frightened to confront the Entity face-to-face.\\n\\nDrusera has stated on more than one occasion that the Entity wants her powers for itself. If that eventuality were to somehow take place, the  consequences for planet Nexus, as well as the universe beyond, would be unimaginably catastrophic.\\n\\nWhat conclusions can we draw at this point? The fate of the Eldan is somehow inextricably tied to the creation of the Genesis Prime, as well as the emergence of the Entity. But the relationship between these two is complex and frustratingly opaque. We can only hope that Drusera can give us further insight into what is happening before it is too late for us all. \\n\\n==================================\\n\\n ADDITIONAL\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nCommander Stonebreaker's most recent request has been soundly rejected.

This fact comes as no surprise to the XAS, given the data that we have collected throughout our research here on Nexus.\\n\\nAccording to Drusera, and corroborated by information extracted from datacubes throughout the complex, the Eldan attempted to destroy the Entity near the end of the Nexus Project. Unfortunately, the creature broke free of its restraints and  laid waste to the facility. It also appears that the Eldan were eradicated during this event as well. If any remain on the planet, we have yet to discover them.\\n\\nHaving arrived too late to help her creators, it appears that Drusera used her considerable powers to imprison the Entity in the monolithic exanite structure known as the Lightspire. It has now been imprisoned there almost a thousand years. According to Drusera, it won't hold the beast for much longer.\\n\\nWhat exactly does this mean?  First and foremost, it appears as if the Entity we have observed is merely a projection of the actual creature - not unlike Drusera herself. If indeed this is the case, then the true power of the Entity must be mind-boggling.\\n\\nSecondly, despite her considerable capabilities, Drusera does not appear to have the ability to destroy the Entity. If the Eldan considered Drusera a god, then the Entity should be afforded the same status.\\n\\nFurther questions come to mind. Where, exactly, is Drusera?  If she is truly the Genesis Prime, then why can't she destroy the Entity? Although her assistance has been extremely enlightening, there are still aspects of her story that are either unclear or misleading. Can we actually trust her?

That these accomplishments were all the work of a single agent serves as still further proof of the shoddiness of Exile defenses.\\n\\nWhile our operative was able with minimal interfacing to reprogram the Annihilator, the full range of its destructive capabilities is still uncertain. Speculations as to the unit's original annihilatees remains under debate, with popular theories  ranging from tectonic reconfiguration and satellite creation to repelling trespassers. But who such trespassers could have been remains unanswered and perhaps unanswerable.\\n\\nThough a laudable act, the total destruction of the facility and its hundreds of on-site Exile personnel does leave us guessing on several fronts: was the prevalence of cybernetic security forces a purely tactical decision or had the Exiles made progress in analyzing the Annihilator's circuitry?  If the latter, perhaps the timing of our assault was even more auspicious than anticipated.\\n\\nHYPOTHESES:\\n\\nWhile the assault is being widely (and rightly) hailed as a military success, a surprising amount of useful intel on the Eldan was also gleaned in the process. We now know that for all their omnipotence the Eldan still felt the need for external security units. Large ones. This strongly suggests either vigilance against a previously unrecorded threat or simply distaste for their activities being  observed. Which of these proves the case, only time will tell.\\n\\nFurthermore, considering the speed with which even Exile scholars were able to bring the Annihilator online, we can also safely assume that it is self-powered, technically accessible, and almost certainly not the only of its kind. Sweeps for comparable energy signatures in unmapped regions are already in progress. \\n\\n==================================\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\\n\\n==================================\\n\\n While FCON reports corroborate that the Exiles' ability to construct another research emplacement in the region will not be possible soon, that the present whereabouts of the Annihilator is uncertain is an ongoing topic of concern.

While we are still sifting through all the implications of the reports, several new revelations have already put our research far ahead. Not least among these is the confirmed existence of the Elder Cube itself, and with some degree of certainty its continued existence on Nexus.\\n\\n That the Eldan used Skeech as test specimens has already been well archived. That some remain not only preserved but alive would seem to be the result of properties inherent in the environment and not the Skeech themselves. Dissection by the newly dispatched teams should settle the issue, interference by the Caretaker or construct reinforcements notwithstanding.  \\n\\nHYPOTHESES:\\n\\nThe notion that the Elder Cube \"rejected\" Artemis Zin on genetic grounds or according to criteria for which  we have no template should be investigated, but seems unlikely. The Caretaker's central role would seem to preclude this possibility, as he/it made no direct reference to such hurdles. Moreover, Zin herself was not the operative who physically recovered the key fragments. To all of which we must add the by no means inconsequential fact that she survived its ostensible rejection.\\n\\nWhere then did the Elder Cube go? Unknown. Was its relocation the desired outcome all along, either on the Caretaker's part or the Cube's? Failure as an integral stepping-stone to all solutions is a critical Eldan concept that we have seen exemplified time and again. \\n\\nAgain we see evidence that they linked prestige with intellectual challenge.  While this assertion alone is of mild intrinsic value, it is comforting to note that, godlike as they were, the Eldan were not incapable of hubris.

However, natural seepage may be partly responsible for the skeledroid phenomenon in this area. If some substance or alchemical concoction mutated into something that could reanimate bones, the seepage may have  hidden it.\\n\\nHYPOTHESES:\\n\\nLady Zin's report confirmed the extreme danger of augmentation, most notably the fact that a creature need not even be alive to be infected - even a skeleton, so long as it is organic in origin, may act as a host for the nanobiotic parasite.\\n\\nThis raises the unsettling possibility that augmentation could jump not only to dead bones, but to completely inorganic life forms.  Even computers, vehicles, and starships. Did the Eldan face a rebellion of their own dead, or the disposed remains of their failed experiments rising to take the lives of their creators? The very fact the record before you exists seems proof they did not - for if augmented Eldan existed, surely they would have shown themselves. If anything, the number of corpses amid the wreckage shows the dangers of anything or anyone  fighting against the Eldan.\\n\\nWhat about the Caretaker? The Eldan AI has shown a considerable diversity of personalities, and one of those could conceivably have deceived and betrayed the Eldan, tricking them into leaving the planet or even sabotaging a lethal experiment. This too seems extremely unlikely, however - all evidence points to the Caretaker's current fractured state as a result of centuries of neglect and network decay. \\n\\n==================================\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nIt is unknown whether physical contact with skeledroids can lead to inadvertent augmentation, but so far the test subject appears to be doing well and shows no signs of infection.

The self-inflicted form of augmentation affecting devotees of the so-called \"Ascendancy\" permits them a modicum of control (or at least the illusion thereof). Although it does not rob the victim of conscious thought, it does confer the well-known perks of the process, including: increased strength, endurance, and fortitude.\\n \\nThe undisputed leader of the Ascendancy is Calidor Antevian, brother of the legendary hero Toric Antevian. Now christening himself \"Brother Calidor,\" the erstwhile Vigilant cleric appears to be the primary carrier/figurehead for the entire cult.\\n\\nAugment Facility X426 is the sole source of this \"Ascendant\" augmentation. It has also been confirmed as the facility responsible for the production and (no pun intended) ascendance of the bipedal cyborg popularly dubbed \"Metal Maw,\" which may help to  explain the unusual characteristics of the nanobiotic infection.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\n\\nFrom all available evidence, the Ascendancy appears quite interested in disseminating their \"gospel\" of augmentation planetwide as soon as possible. Our records confirm that Calidor Antevian was a figure who saw himself constantly in the shadow of his brother Toric, the \"Vigilant Star,\" who leads our Radiant Legion. It is quite conceivable that defects he observed in his own personality played a role in the subservient  attitude of those who now follow him. Calidor's fervently expressed urge to spread the irreversible effects of \"Ascendant\" augmentation to new acolytes - willing or otherwise - led to his followers' attack of the local Pell in an audacious attempt to convert them. \\n\\nThat said, DRED analysts consider it doubtful that Ascendant augmentation played any role in the disappearance of the Eldan. For that matter, there is no evidence that the movement even existed before Calidor formalized (or in his words  \"discovered\") its existence. \\n\\nAugmentation as a general concept has cropped up time and again in our studies of the Eldan, with the events at Augment Facility X426 serving only as the most recent (and dramatic). However, as there have been exactly zero reports of augmented Eldan wandering Nexus, it is the judgment of this panel that such an outbreak ever having occurred is a remote possibility. DRED has determined after encounters with the Ascendancy that had similarly augmented Eldan existed, they  would have certainly wiped out half the galaxy by now.\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nADDITIONAL\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nChemical analysis confirms that Metal Maw is indeed composed of a hyperbonded megasteel alloy. Visual analysis confirms that Metal Maw has a truly enormous mouth. Further analysis is not recommended without substantial armed backup.",

    "content": "==================================\\n\\nKEY FINDINGS:\\n\\nBased on the latest evidence, the Eldan conducted their most dangerous experiments on Farside. The bio-domes here are generally intact, along with numerous surviving specimens or descendants of same. They are supremely volatile and should be approached with care if at all.\\n\\nWe discovered substantial evidence of terraforming experiments. Machines devoted to this purpose are not only present, but operational, often  resulting in overlapping biomes in unstable juxtaposition. Mutations of fauna indigenous to the surface were also reported, along with vacuum-adapted specimens.\\n\\nFarside is heavily infested with mutated squirg, their dangerous attributes likely the result of prolonged exposure to the primal energies already noted in the area. Due to this, they are consequently more aggressive. \\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\n\\nEldan terraforming technology was once the envy of the galaxy. Legends and atmospheric evidence of their  power to manipulate ecologies, worlds, and even star systems were ubiquitous even during the heyday of the Commonwealth. While signs of such mastery have occasionally been found on the planet's surface, Farside's terraformers are of another order of magnitude entirely.\\n\\nThese show signs of abandonment but not outright destruction, suggesting that their deterioration may simply be the product of natural forces or an exhaustion of local resources. Countering these innocuous speculations is the  Halon Ring. While such formations are hardly unique, our readings indicate that whatever caused its creation did so in the recent geological past. For now the involvement of terraformers is moot.\\n\\nAs scientists, we must be open to the possibility the Eldan did not ascend to godhood, a concept the high sentinel herself has granted us dispensation to pursue. All of which leads us to the startling possibility that there may have been no single reason for the Eldan's disappearance. We have been proceeding of  late under the assumption that they are dead. Yet perhaps they simply pulled up stakes following a confluence of unexpected events that needn't have been fatal. An asteroid may have impacted Farside during a critical conflict between Eldan and Megadroids. The squirg may have taken up residence following a parasitic outbreak. Rampant augmentation may have unbalanced an as-yet-undiscovered Focus or Primeval. \\n\\nOr perhaps the Eldan really did ascend to godhood. That would certainly be welcome news in  certain quarters.\\n\\nUnfortunately, all evidence suggests that the disappearance of the Eldan was abrupt, thorough, and (above conjectures notwithstanding) involuntary. Their continued silence since our arrival is not encouraging. \\n\\n==================================\\n\\nADDITIONAL\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nBreathing apparatuses are required for survival over large stretches of the Farside surface.

Not only do we now have a clear idea about the true nature of the Nexus Project, it appears that we also have access to an individual who was created by the Eldan themselves, and may have been present at the time of their disappearance. \\n\\nAt this  point we cannot fully ascertain whether or not Drusera is a reliable source of information, but datacubes found throughout Exo-Lab Prime seem to corroborate the important points of her story. It also appears that the Eldan had some difficulty in developing the technology that was necessary to create the Genesis Prime, but that at some point designs for a \"Protoplasmic Resonator\" were mysteriously delivered by the leader of the Nexus Project. The source of this advanced technology is yet unknown. \\n\\nDetails about the full capabilities of the Genesis Prime are still undefined, although a datacube entry by the virtual construct known as the Caretaker seems to indicate that its powers are virtually limitless. If Drusera is indeed the Genesis Prime, then her ethereal figure would appear to be little more than a means of communication, with limited power to affect the real world.

The details surrounding its origins are still disturbingly unclear.\\n\\nThe Eldan were unsuccessful in developing an effective defense against the Strain. Given the horrendous condition of the infected organisms within Exo-Lab X39,  this fact is extremely concerning.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\n\\nThe information collected in Exo-Lab X39 is both enlightening and disturbing. First and foremost, this facility had been tightly secured by the Eldan, who appeared to believe it required the highest level of quarantine from the outside world. It was only with the assistance of Drusera that we were able to bypass the advanced security measures in order to observe the organisms inside.\\n\\n Those observations were indeed frightening. According to Drusera, the virulent biological infection known as the Strain appeared not long after her creation. Datacube recordings reveal that the Eldan were both impressed and concerned with its capacity to infect and transform any biological creature that it came in contact with. \\n\\nAlthough the evidence is so-far inconclusive, it has been theorized that the Eldan were somehow responsible for engineering the Strain.  What is clear is that they were unable to create an effective vaccine against its effects, despite the advanced level of their technology. Drusera seemed particularly concerned about this fact. It appears that she was hoping to discover information to the contrary.\\n\\nCould the Strain be what was ultimately responsible for the Eldan's disappearance? If so, why haven't we discovered any examples of the infection outside of this exo-lab?  At this point, we seem to have more questions than we do answers.

Once again our agent infiltrated a crucial Eldan location via a portal that appeared on the outskirts of Illium. This time, however, instead of making contact with Drusera as before, they encountered  a malign presence identifying itself as \"the Entity.\"\\n\\nEven simply from the recordings and descriptions provided, the disconcerting qualities of this being (or force) are difficult to articulate in mere text. In addition to a physical presence that can only be described as \"dread-inducing,\" from its speech the being is assuredly of remarkable intelligence. It possesses an intimate knowledge of the Eldan and their activities on Nexus only possible through personal acquaintance. Among its many  revelations were the Entity's decisive claims that it was the Eldan's creation, that it had created the Strain, and that the rival creature calling itself Drusera has been deceptive with respect to historical events. \\n\\nThe Entity expressed particular interest in the background and profile of our agent, along with clinical curiosity as to why Drusera had singled this person out. As proof of this, our agent was subjected to a thorough series of scans and trials, from which the Entity purportedly designed  Strain mutations that it designated \"the Skurge.\" Their precise function is still uncertain.\\n\\nWhat does seem a foregone conclusion is that the Entity played a role in the disappearance of the Eldan, although the full extent of said role has yet to be determined. Based on the data at hand, FCON has been put on high alert and our spies report similar escalations at many Exile camps. As trusting or predicting the behavior of the Entity, let alone controlling it, remains beyond our current capabilities,  we are currently at work discussing feasible responses.\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nADDITIONAL\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nKezrek Warbringer's proposal during our panel's last session to \"disembowel this Entity and feed it its own stomach\" is deeply appreciated in both sentiment and technique, and we always welcome the input of those in High Command.

Multiple accounts confirm her ability to create sentient life at will. This alone would doubtless be hailed as the most significant scientific discovery of our age, were it not for the realities the existence of the Entity now forces us to confront. \\n\\nTaking into account all compiled data regarding the Nexus Project, it appears certain that the original purpose of the Genesis Prime was to fulfill the cherished Eldan goal of creating the Perfect Being. Based on our observations thus far, it is safe to say their efforts exceeded their intentions. The full measure of Drusera's capabilities is still being quantified.\\n\\nBut such studies are ineffably threatened by the increasing power and ambitions of her dark counterpart. Drusera truly dreads  this \"Entity,\" and her own abilities are clearly less effective against the Strain. Despite her assurances of safety, she proved unable to shield our agent from the Entity's malign minions. In fact, our operative reports that during the episode, Drusera, our one hope of combating this being, fled the scene in disgrace.\\n\\nOn several occasions Drusera has averred her unswerving assertion that the Entity desires to co-opt her powers for its own aggrandizement. If this eventuality were  to transpire, we can only assume that the consequences for the planet - and perhaps all life as we know it - would be devastating.\\n\\nWhat conclusions do we have sufficient evidence for at this juncture? The mystery of what happened to the Eldan is without a doubt related to the history and aims of the Genesis Prime, as well as the emergence of the Entity. But the relationship between these two is frustratingly opaque in many details.

They entered the Terminus Complex, a structure created as a contingency, to take preventive measures against it.\\n\\nThese efforts were unsuccessful. The Entity took control of the installation, which resulted in the destruction of the Eldan civilization.\\n\\nDespite failing to save the Eldan, Drusera managed to erect a colossal formation of exanite known as the Lightspire  and imprison the Entity within, knowing that such countermeasures were temporary.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\n\\nThe final fate of the Eldan is a mystery no longer.\\n\\nBased on the data gathered in the wake of the Terminus Complex incident, the Eldan were indeed destroyed by the Entity.\\n\\nAs related by Drusera and corroborated by datacubes recovered from the Complex, the Eldan recognized the threat posed by the Entity and attempted to eradicate it at the end of the Nexus Project. They failed.  In turn, the Entity laid waste to the facility and slaughtered its personnel. The existence of any survivors from this conflict has yet to be reported.\\n\\nDespite her inability to save her creators, Drusera was able to construct a massive exanite structure known as the Lightspire, which effectively incarcerated the Entity for roughly a thousand years. However, in the estimation of both Drusera and our own geologists, its continued integrity is in serious question.\\n\\nWhat do we know for certain?  First and foremost, the organism we have so far termed the Entity is, for lack of more precise terms, merely a projection of its identity, not unlike Drusera. It may well be that both organisms in their \"true\" state bear little resemblance to anything within our comprehension.\\n\\nFurthermore, despite the breadth of her capabilities, Drusera remains incapable of dealing with the Entity. To put matters in perspective, the Eldan considered Drusera a goddess. Ergo, it would hardly be hyperbole to accord  the Entity a corresponding status.\\n\\nInevitably, the additional data compels even more hopeless inquiry. Where is Drusera now? If, as widely countenanced, she is omnipotent, why is she incapable of destroying the Entity? And while her insights have been on the whole beneficial, can we trust her? Moreover, do we have a choice?\\n\\nDRED has advised the immediate implementation of mass evacuation protocols across the planet.

Why does it infest Grimvault like the Strain that surrounds it? Our data is frighteningly limited, for a host of reasons. The most significant, of course, is that the damnable thing mentally enslaves anyone sent to study it!\\n\\nOne thing is certain - the Globellum and the Strain are not working in concert with each other.  Indeed, the bubbles in which the Globellum traps and keeps those it enslaves are completely resistant to the Strain. In fact, the Globellum may be the first organism of any kind that appears to have immunity to corruption. So far, at least.\\n\\nPerhaps the Eldan created the Globellum to be a fail-safe, but this seems highly unlikely. There is nothing in the primal signatures of the few samples we've been able to to indicate an artificial origin.  All taking samples taught us was that every piece of the Globellum appears to be psionically linked to the central brain-mass. Even a single cell could be enough to regrow the creature, even if firebombed from orbit. Eradicating the Globellum may well be impossible. Therefore, containment is the best possible option.\\n\\nDid the Eldan think so too? Did they imprison the Globellum in the Grimvault to prevent it from escaping into the universe?  There is little evidence to indicate this is the case. Indeed, the Strain more than anything is keeping Globellum in check. \\n\\nIf we ever do succeed in defeating the Strain, will Nexus simply trade one horror for another? We cannot take that chance. We must study the Globellum and understand it. We must ensure it understands us. And ensure it understands the Dominion is not an enemy even it wants to make.\\n\\nWith any luck they won't know we're bluffing.",

    "content": "[A Mordesh-written guide to dealing with relatives or beloved family pets who have become infected with Strain corruption. It is not a lengthy volume.]\\n\\nWhile our race has already suffered most cruely at fate's cold hand, another burden is becoming increasingly common amongst Mordesh living on the planet Nexus - Strain-corrupted loved ones. Be they friends, lovers, family or beloved pets we can no more turn our backs to those subsumed into the Strain's sickly substance than we can our Ravenous brethren.  So, here are a few guidelines to help both Caretaker and Corrupted:\\n\\nDON'T TOUCH THE CORRUPTED\\nThe Strain is a hyper-aggressive infectious vector. Not only does it spread through skin-to-skin contact, it has been known to take a running jump from one victim to another. You will be tempted to try to soothe your loved one with a kind touch, but don't. Not even with bio-haz level 5 gauntlets. Not even with a ten-meter vind prod.\\n\\nDON'T BRING THE CORRUPTED HOME\\nIt is natural to want to bring loved  ones who suffer in disease's dreary domain back to a place of warmth and comfort. Do not do this. Worse than having to care and worry for one Corrupted loved one is having to flee a neighborhood infested with purple-black perversions, or become one yourself. There are few, if any, safe ways to contain the Strain.\\n\\nDON'T EVEN GET NEAR THE CORRUPTED\\nThis is the logical extension of the previous two guidelines, and it cannot be stressed enough. Seriously. If you can't bear to be apart from your  diseased darling, it might be possible to wave at them from a reasonable distance, behind a flame-enforced quarantine cordon, inside a hermetically sealed and armored viewing room. Don't forget to sign all applicable liability waviers.\\n\\nCONSIDER EUTHANASIA - PREFERABLY WITH A FLAMETHROWER\\nWe Mordesh have a very conflicted and complex relationship with the concept of euthanasia, as we are, in the most technical sense, already dead. Yet even our fallen Ravenous keep some semblance of their  former selves, if significantly hungrier and more homicidal. The truth is those infected by the Strain are no longer themselves.  We don't know exactly what they have become, but it is part of an unstoppable, vastly intelligent, malignant force. It is no cliche to suggest that here the kindest act is to end their suffering. And if you can't take that last step, a duly authorized official will do it for you.",

It was the kind of land a Draken could love.\\n\\nI crept through the swamp, and thought of the days long past, when I would fish in the cold streams near the clan holding. Slashing down into the clear water, my claws would hook the darting, silver fish. Those were good days, and the fish made fine meals.\\n\\nBut now  I am grown into life's later days. I seek what all Draken seek, a ferocious animal that I will kill to prove my worth. I have done much in my long life, and have scars to show for it. I want just one more good hunt, one more strong foe, one last fine kill.\\n\\nAt the Pell village, I exchanged dried meat cut from a huge Girrok I hunted in Deradune. They fed me with cakes of flat bread that tasted of the earth's minerals and salt, and gave me clear, thin wine to drink. Not the strong liquor I prefer,  but fine and good in the day's hot sun. They told me of a mighty beast in the hills nearby, the hard-shelled Ruga who kills all who come near.\\n\\nMy blood thrilled at the name. Ruga. I almost felt shame at the thought of killing such a fine animal. But even as I loved the beast I had never met, I vowed to kill him just the same. Or he would kill me. It would be good either way.\\n\\nI climbed up the hill where my prey made his rest. My claws dug into the flinty Blighthaven soil.  I could feel the wind blowing through my horns. I stalked my foe, and saw even dug in to sleep he was a great trophy. I felt fear, and am not ashamed to admit it. My heart pounded, muscles coiled, and realized that only at this one moment was I truly alive. Friend Ruga, this old Draken will never forget you.",

    "content": "With the release of LOVE BEHIND THE THRONE, Narrisa Artan has returned to familiar ground. Last year's EMPIRE OF RUIN, the anti-imperial satire set in the early days of the Dominion, was, to say the least, a disappointment to Ms. Artan's fans. Rumor has it the book didn't go down very well with the ICI either (which perhaps explains why Ms. Artan took an unscheduled sabbatical, and had to cancel all book signings and media interviews).\\n\\n A period piece set in the middle years of the Reign of Wisdom, the story centers around Lani Softhand, a lowborn chamber maid in the emperor's palace and her fiery, but doomed love affair with Lord Seraphel. Comfortable with period detail, Artan creates a romantic, believable world filled with intrigue, wonder, and not just a little danger. The book's plucky, gorgeous protagonist pulls the young emperor-to-be out of his academic nook, and into the sensual realm of the lowborn.  If the premise is somewhat cliché, it is redeemed by the clever interweaving of real historic events with ficticious characters and plots.\\n\\nIf there is a flaw to the novel it is the perplexingly uneven tone. Multiple times we see glimpses of the cynical wit that suffused Artan's previous work, which suddenly veers away into trite sentimentality and patriotism.  A good example is when young Lani uncovers what seems to be a plot by the ICI to brutally quash the lowborn spaceport workers' attempt to unionize. Clearly this mirrors the real Port Cassus Riots of 725 AE, but this \"fictional\" storyline is suddenly and nonsensically revealed to be a double ruse, wherein the virtuous ICI is actually protecting the ignorant port workers from the manipulations of an alien enemy. Relieved, Lani says,  \"Thank the Scions for the ICI. They truly are the guardians of the Dominion's moral center.\" A strangely political and patriotic statement for a torrid romance.\\n\\nYes, it is funny, that. And not what the masses call \"ha-ha funny.\" But your humble reviewer will speculate no further, as it does not pay to speculate where even the fictional ICI is concerned.",

    "content": "Dear Transmat User,\\n\\nRecently we've received several complaints about transmat system accidents. To combat the rampant misinformation and rumor that has resulted, we have compiled this useful guide to transmat safety for the layperson.\\n\\nThe first thing to make clear is that matter transmission is the safest form of transportation ever invented. The chance of a malfunction or critical failure is less than .00001%. However, that being said, accidents do happen.  \\n\\nINTERSPECIES BLENDS - It is possible, if members of two different species enter the transmat field at exactly the same moment, for the two subjects to exchange traits or characteristics at the molecular level. We recommend each afflicted party take an inventory of their new capabilities. Is being half-Granok/half-buzzbing a blessing in disguise? (WARNING: Under no circumstances should the user attempt to go back through the transmat system to correct this error,  as this may result in catastrophic discombobulation.)\\n\\nDUPIFICATION - In rare instances, a matter signal echoes or splits, causing a duplicate (or \"dupe\") of the traveler to be created. This is NOT the same as cloning. Due to the precision of the reconstruction process, the dupe is ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL to the original in every way. It may even BE the original, who knows? We are not philosophers.\\n\\nBIOPOSITION FAILURE - This malfunction, also known as \"limb bingo,\" is completely avoidable  with proper maintenance and synchronization of the transmat apparatus. However, the proliferation of transmat pads throughout Nexus, many in inaccessible, remote, or dangerous locations, means our maintenance schedule has become severely backlogged. Rest assured we will get to them all in the near-to-distant future. In the meantime, if you've had some appendages switched around due to a transmat trip, simply fill out a claim with any still-functional manipulating organs  and we may refund the cost of the trip.\\n\\nGENDER REVERSAL - Some travelers report arriving at their destination to find they are not the same sex as they were before they left. We've found that simply transmatting back to the point of origin resets the traveler back to their original gender in almost 72% of the cases. (Note: Chua appear completely immune to this effect.)\\n\\nDEVOLUTION -  The number of components that must fail to reverse the course of evolution is nigh unfathomable, and in all of recorded galactic history only three cases of this mishap have been documented. Unfortunately, the victims hopped, skittered, or slithered away into the underbrush before anyone could run tests.",

It also seems exanite is unlike almost all other crystalline elements in that it will resonate at multiple frequencies, not just one. What might other \"tunings\" of the element generate?  Could its perfect primal balance be destabilized, or even weaponized? What might such a frequency do to the soul shards of the Mechari, for example?\\n\\n[Field Note - 1:112:0007 - Resonator Tower]\\nPreliminary investigation of the Resonator Tower consoles shows the Progenitors' research data still exists in the buffers.

Get ready for fun, violence, companionship, and violence for years to come with your New and Improved ZN-6300 Defense Turret! Get started the safe way with these handy tips for beginners.\\n\\nFRIENDSHIP - \\nAfter unboxing, your ZN-6300 Defense Turret might be a little shy. It's only known the factory before, so that's understandable. The first thing you should do is introduce yourself. The ZN-6300's updated IFF (Identify Friend or  Foe) circuit makes this a snap. Simply activate the IFF circuit and, for obvious reasons, make sure the switch is set to identify you as a \"Friend.\" Then stand in front of your new metal pal and let its pheromone sniffers get a good whiff while targeting lasers memorize your appearance. When it goes \"ping\" you have made a friend for life! Or at least until its IFF circuit randomly resets (which in the new ZN-6300 is 75% less likely to happen). Then you'll have to register your friend status all over again. \\n\\nPLAYTIME - \\nEvery Turret owner should understand that playing with your trigger-happy buddy is very important, and indeed vitally necessary to ensure no accidental resets of the IFF circuit. However, unless you paid for the optional \"Patrol-Treads\" movement package, you're going to be disappointed in your Turret's ability to fetch. We recommend the far simpler game of \"Throw the ball, then shoot it,\" which your Turret will never tire of playing. Well, until its ammo trays run empty, then it will never  tire of playing \"throw the ball and track it with your state-of-the-art tracking system.\"\\n\\nAPPROVED GAMES - \\nSIT, STAY, SCAN PERIMETER: Sometimes it might seem like this crazy game is all your turret ever wants to do! Don't worry, that's just because it's the unit's default setting.\\n\\nHOT FOOT\\nDrop in a load of incendiary rounds, set your Turret's target preference to \"Lower Extremities\" and wait for the fun to start. Defense turrets love to make Exiles dance. Dance, Exile, dance!\\n\\nI SPY WITH MY  LITTLE EYE WHAT NEEDS TO DIE: Every Turret comes with a handheld targeting control. With it you can play this fun guessing game. Place an object in the handheld's targeting reticule and say \"I spy with my little eye...\" If the object disappears under a hail of energy bolts, your Turret guessed correctly. If not, please call an authorized service technician. Your Turret may need adjustment.\\n\\nTARGET PRACTICE: It's hard to resist this fun and addictive game, but remember Turrets are very competitive.  They may take losing badly and \"accidentally\" reset their IFF circuit. Play Target Practice only with extreme caution and, if possible, while a powerful force shield separates you and your Turret.\\n\\n With proper care and maintenance, you can expect years of fun and loyal companionship from your Turret.\\n\\nSo remember: enjoy, respect, and fear your new ZN-6300 - the defense turret that makes defending FUN!",

Better yet, cut it down and disintegrate it, for it puts your mind and very soul in grave peril. I, Winton W. Wishtar, know first-hand the evil of the so-called \"Bounty Board.\" And now I share this information with you, for the betterment of all.\\n\\nYou may think I'm crazy. I don't blame you. I questioned my sanity at first too. All I ask is that you keep  an open mind while I tell my story. Decide for yourself what is true.\\n\\nI was once an explorer, and money and glory were the things that got me out of my bedroll every morning. Where else to find copious amounts of both? The Bounty Board! I brought down target after target, and reaped the poisonous rewards. \\n\\nThen the headaches started. It was like a line of fire cutting my head in half. I saw medics and alchemists but they couldn't help. Psychosomatic, they said. I couldn't work, couldn't sleep,  couldn't explore, all I could do is cower in a dark cargo container and pray the pain would go away. I'm not ashamed that I gave serious thought to stepping off Thayd's highest wall to make it stop.\\n\\nOne day, shuffling through Spaceport Horizon in a red, pain-tinged haze, I felt a moment's relief. As I passed a kiosk offering work to adventurers for hire, the molten spike from between my eyes went away. I looked around for an explanation, but there was none. Then I moved away, and almost collapsed as  the pain came pounding back. It was the board! Something about the board gave me relief, and not just that one. With careful experimentation, I found that Bounty Boards all over Nexus have the same effect. If I took a bounty, the pain would go away for a longer time.\\n\\nI came to realize I was a slave of the boards. As I took bounty after bounty, I looked into who and what was behind the Bounty Board system. I found this to be more difficult than it should be. \\n\\nEveryone assumes they are made by  Protostar, but no one's sure. Distributors were hidden behind corporate shell companies. No one's ever seen one being installed. For all I could tell they just appear, in all their seductive, blinky, blinking glory.\\n\\nThis is what I can tell you: the original investment came from a loan Serrik Brightland made to Phineas T. Rotostar way, way back. The first Boards were built by Protostar, but in factories owned by the Dominion Emperor Myrcalus. The weird thing is that while Boards were being built years  and years ago, no one remembers seeing any UNTIL WE ARRIVED ON NEXUS!\\n\\nI don't know what all this means, but it has to mean something. It has to! Could I have invented all of this? Could I just have made this up on the spot? ANYTHING is possible, friends... but can you take that chance, no matter how insane this tale seems? YOU CANNOT!\\n\\nSo beware the Board, friends. Beware the Board!",

That's the real question.\\n\\nShe and the Entity share a physical form. For practical purposes they're the same physical being.

That they are completely separate in terms of identity is indeed tragic for Drusera, but may provide the key to defeating her dark counterpart. \\n\\nDrusera hid this fact from us all - and to call this a significant omission is an understatement. While not an outright lie, it was certainly manipulative - even underhanded - but she claims to have had good reason to do so. And it is clear that centuries of internal struggle have taken their toll on her. Even with her almost limitless power, she is exhausted and does not know how much longer she can sustain the fight. If the Entity escapes and gets control of the Genesis Prime's powers,  then it is quite possible that nothing known to Dominion science could oppose his plot to re-make the Universe in his image.\\n\\nAgain, the question: Can we trust Drusera? We have little choice. She is the Entity's weak spot, and that makes her our best ally in this fight. The Destiny Initiative must succeed where the Eldan failed, so we will continue to aid this impossible being. Drusera's survival is, unfortunately, only a secondary objective.

One, that of Drusera, and two, that of the Entity.  Although they lack the knowledge to truly understand what has transpired, the Eldan seem to believe that the Entity's personality consists of the strongest and most volatile behavioral characteristics of the six vessels which were used to create the Genesis Prime. \\n\\nConsequently, instead of the blank slate which was expected, Drusera's mind is in a state of perpetual war - one that she is slowly and steadily losing to the stronger, more aggressive Entity.  What started out as brief episodes of erratic behavior have become complete psychological transformations characterized by physical changes and the creation of the biological anomaly known as the Strain. It is only a matter of time before she completely succumbs.\\n\\nAs far as who is responsible for the adjustment which led to this catastrophic outcome, I have my suspicions.

It is an artificial planet built by the Eldan for one reason: creating the Genesis Prime.\\n\\nAll life on Nexus was engineered by the Eldan to contribute to the Genesis Project in some way. They even created the gigantic Primevals to be proof-of-concept prototypes of early primal infusion techniques.\\n\\nAfter many years of research  the actual technology that would finally create the Genesis Prime remained out of the Eldan's reach. They received the designs for the machine that combined six Eldan vessels into one all-powerful being - the Protoplasmic Resonator - from an unknown source. \\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\n\\nIt seems even with their awesome technology and limitless drive, the Eldan could make mistakes. This news should make even the most hardcore Dominion zealot realize they were no gods.  They were mortal, with flaws and weaknesses just like us.\\n\\nIt's extremely unfortunate that one of those flaws might very well eat us all and destroy the universe.\\n\\nThat said, putting the Caretaker back together certainly paid off. Many questions about our new home have been answered; like why there are so many humanoids on Nexus, how such a geologically young planet can have such an evolved biosphere, and how its strange micro-climates develop as distinct biomes over time. \\n\\nWe're closer than we've ever been to unravelling the mysteries of Nexus.

If they are, why haven't they come back? Maybe they are here and we just don't know it? \\n\\nWhy did they want to make the Genesis Prime so badly?

Nexus is not the Eldan homeworld. It's not even a natural planet. The Eldan built the entire world simply to create the Genesis Prime.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Eldan both actively and passively engineered all life on Nexus to contribute in some way to the Genesis Project. For example, the great Primevals were proof-of-concept prototypes  of early primal infusion techniques.\\n\\nHowever, they did not come up with the actual breakthrough that created the Genesis Prime, even after years of research. The designs for the Protoplasmic Resonator, a machine that combined six Eldan vessels into one all-powerful being, came to them from an unknown outside source. \\n\\nHYPOTHESES:\\n\\nThe sobering truth is that even with their awesome technology and near limitless drive, the Eldan made mistakes. They were mortals,  with flaws and weaknesses just like us. Perhaps they were not divine, but they are still worthy of our respect. \\n\\nAt least, up to the point that one of their mistakes kills us all, subsumes our biomass, and remakes the universe in its horrific image.\\n\\nWe braved many dangers and overcame many challenges to put the Caretaker back together, and it certainly paid off. The little inconsistencies and puzzles about this planet now make sense.  These facts explain why Nexus has so many humanoid creatures, how a geologically immature planet possesses a highly evolved biosphere, what conditions made its micro-climates arise, and even illuminates the ways they are independently sustained.\\n\\nOur understanding of Nexus has expanded exponentially. But the important questions, those imperative for the Dominion's continued survival, remain unresolved. \\n\\nFrom where do the Eldan, our \"gods,\" actually originate?  Are they still waiting for us to find them? Do they even now watch use in secret, judging our worthiness? If they are... why? \\n\\nWhy did they want to make the Genesis Prime? Was it in pursuit of pure scientific understanding or something more mundane? Was she merely the first step of a larger plan? It is both a terrifying and exhilarating thought.\\n\\nFor now we must answer a more urgent question: who gave the Archon the Protoplasmic Resonator. This being may be our only hope to separate  the Entity from Drusera.\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS\\n\\n==================================\\n\\nIt is the recommendation of the DRED Safety and Social Responsibility Council that this document and all the information within should be immediately disavowed and CLASSIFIED under the Imperial Secrets Act of 325 AE.

    "content": "Mayor,\\n\\nSince you won't listen to my voiced objections, here are my \"Roan Project\" notes to be entered into the Cult archives.\\n\\nRowsdowers incubate the divine vector well, but the carrier yield is too small. They just have too little biomass. We need a host that produces two or three times the shadeling yield, but retains the rowsdower capacity for explosive maturation. \\n\\nUnfortunately it looks like the roan is not this host.\\n\\n On the plus side, we are not experiencing the immune response that caused so much trouble when we began the rowsdower trials. In the first batch alone, we lost 85% of the host animals. So, it's nice that we don't have to waste any time engineering immune-neutral primal membranes.\\n\\nHowever, that one positive is heavily outweighed by all the negatives. First, something in the roan lower digestive tract is actually metabolizing the vector precursors.  All our efforts and trouble to culture the vector precursors down in the bunker, and they just end up part of a steaming pile in the field.\\n\\nNext, the lack of immune-response is a mixed blessing. Instead of the precursors taking root and maturing into viable shadelings, they are making the roan keel over from massive septicemia.\\n\\nThird, the shadelings that ARE hatching from the roan hosts are sub-optimal. It shouldn't be possible,  but it appears there is epi-genetic cross contamination passing from the host to the shadeling. The long and short of it is that we get a vector that is more interested in grazing than spreading the Divine Infection.\\n\\nDon't talk to me about destiny. We have real science challenges here that we need to overcome first.\\n\\n- Nate Whispergrove",

We know the settlers came down with the Shades soon after they made planetfall. Where did they come from? Why did they leave that place?  Important questions like that are glossed over by the trumped-up drama of a deadly plague that never happened. It's claimed the Shades was a form of Spacer's Plague, but what evidence do we have? Then at an appropriately dire moment, the night before everybody was going to die, a girl with immunity to the disease was miraculously found. This seems absurdly convenient. Then the \"Angel\" sacrifices herself so that her blood can be used to cure the ill.  Why would she have to die? That's not the way vaccines and inoculations work.

The trick is to incentivize them so they want to crawl on their own.\\n\\n9. ELECTROCUTION\\nSomewhat pedestrian, but there is so  much you can do with electricity. It can be soft and silent, with just enough of a shock to stop their heart. Sizzling and popping, that slowly fries the meat right off the bone. Or loud and spectacular, with A HUGE LIGHTNING DISCHARGE!\\n\\n8. DROPPING HEAVY WEIGHTS ONTO THEM\\nNothing makes me chortle like smashing an intruder to a bloody pulp.

EXSANGUINATION: SKINNING ALIVE\\nI don't do this all that often, it's more for special occasions. It takes all sorts of preparation and planning, but seeing a skinless marauder run around all EXPOSED TENDONS AND MUSCLES UNTIL HE DROPS FROM BLOOD LOSS! Well... it just warms my sick virtual-heart.\\n\\n4. EXSANGUINATION: INTERNAL HEMORRHAGING\\nThis too  is a special occasion kill, mostly because it's so messy. There are lots of ways to make a victim bleed from all their orifices: viral infection, traumatic organ failure, poison, and so on. My favorite is poisoned cupcakes. I don't know why. \\n\\n3. EXSANGUINATION: SPACE VAMPIRES\\nAdmittedly, this method is still hypothetical as I have not discovered a species of space vampire willing to participate in this experiment. But when I do, THE BLOOD WILL FLY! At least, hypothetically. \\n\\n2. DISINTEGRATION\\nWho doesn't like a good disintegration? THE SAP BEING DISINTEGRATED, THAT'S WHO! No muss, no fuss - zap and they're gone.\\n\\n1. TEARING THEM LIMB FROM LIMB\\nCall me a crazy AI construct, because let us face it - I am - but I really prefer the old-fashioned, simpler ways of getting things done. Don't get me wrong, I'm as up for an ultra-elaborate death contraption as the next artificially intelligent lunatic, but there's something very \"real,\" in the parlance of sapients,  about TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS WITH MY OWN HANDS!

    "content": "As the hypercube projection faded away in OMNICore-1's Cortex chamber, Axis Pheydra and $(player) stood somber and silent. Yes, the Cortex Controller's torn, smoking metal chassis still littered the chamber, and the Caretaker's avatar glowed worryingly bright now that his neural core was reassembled, but that's not why they were so quiet.\\n\\nNo, it was fatigue from the almost constant combat they marched through to get here, and shock from what the hypercube revealed - or more precisely  didn't reveal.\\n\\nGetting into OMNICore-1 was not an undue challenge. The access door had been sealed, but somehow the lock console recognized Pheydra and granted her \"Omega-level\" security access. Strangely, the console interface triggered a memory fragment in Pheydra's crystalline neural core, but she couldn't put a manipulator digit on it. Clearly these \"Omega-level\" privileges indicated she was created for a further, mysterious purpose.\\n\\nOnce they were inside, Avatus did everything  he could to thwart their progress, from erecting formidable firewalls to unleashing brutal hardlight beasts. Working as a unit, they fought across abysmal chasms and climbed through forgotten access tunnels. Pheydra was impressed by the $p(player.race) mission performance. Pheydra could recall when $(player) was newly decanted from the cryo pod. Now $p(player) impressive deeds in service to the Dominion were widely  celebrated. Pheydra conceded that $p(player) participation in this mission greatly increased its success parameters.\\n\\nIn the Cortex chamber, Avatus set an enormous, aggressive construct on them. Pheydra's $(player.class) comrade fended off the Cortex Controller's powerful assault. It was only $p(player) final, overwhelming attack that sent the monster offline. The path to repair the Caretaker was open.\\n\\nAfter $(player) pulled the kill switch, the Caretaker's neural core reintegrated,  and all of the mysterious Nexus Project's secrets were revealed. The Caretaker's stores of data were vast, but he did not possess the information they needed most: how to separate the Entity from Drusera.\\n\\nApparently, that important fact could be found someplace called the \"Vault of the Archon.\"\\n\\nWith time running out before the Entity seized Drusera's god-like power to remake the universe in his own twisted image, this small omission would have activated anyone's depression  subroutines.\\n\\nBut Pheydra wasn't discouraged. In fact, if she were able to, she might have smiled.\\n\\nThey'd overcome many obstacles, and undoubtedly many challenges lay ahead, but they'd prevail. They'd find a way to separate the Entity from Drusera, then obliterate him. With citizens like $(player) loyally assisting, Pheydra predicted success was the most likely outcome.",

    "content": "A holoprojector is a complex machine that we take for granted most of the time - up until it stops working correctly. If your holoprojector is on the fritz, 90% of the time you can get it back to normal function by following these simple steps.\\n\\nSYMPTOM: Holoprojector does not turn on.\\n\\nSTEPS TO FIX\\n1 - Check to see if the unit is connected to a power source. This could be a battery, a micro-fusion cell, or an aetheric trans-wave. If it is connected and the problem persists,  move to the next step.\\n2 - Clean the power contacts. Obviously disconnect the power source first, as serious injury could otherwise result. Use titanium wool and a fine-grit nano-polishing paste, and rub the power contacts in a counter clock-wise direction. DO NOT rub them in a clock-wise direction under any circumstances, as catastrophic molecular breakdown could occur. Then connect the power source. If the problem persists, move to the next step.\\n3 - Check for pest infestation.  Jabbits and other small creatures, but especially jabbits, find the warmth and sub-sonic hum of the units comforting, and see the housing as a pleasant den. They also like chewing on the wire insulation, so you may need to replace the entire unit's wiring.\\n\\nSYMPTOM: Holo-image is blurry or flickers\\n\\nSTEPS TO FIX\\n1 - Check to see if focus crystals are dirty or damaged. Clean or replace as needed. If the problem persists, move to the next step.\\n2 -  Check that focus crystals are aligned correctly. There is a test pattern stored in the memory of each holo-projector unit. Select it. If the color gradient, parallax chart, or gray-scale patterns are malformed, then the focus crystals are misaligned. Use the alignment screws to adjust until the pattern is clear and crisp. If the problem persists, move to the next step.\\n3 - Check for pest infestation. As mentioned above, Jabbits like nesting in holo-projectors.  It is likely their bodies are blocking the holo-emitters.\\n\\nSYMPTOM: Holo-Projector turns itself on and off, changes channels randomly, or displays eerie spectral images\\nSTEPS TO FIX\\n\\n1 -  Check that remote control buttons are not jammed. 70% of the time this issue is caused by a user sitting on the remote and not realizing it. If problem persists, move on to next step.\\n2 - Check the memory buffer for unauthorized programming. Strange holo-projector behavior is frequently  caused by malicious programming, especially during the Shade's Eve season. Clear the memory buffer. WARNING! Do not do this if your unit displays the symptom associated with next step.\\n3 - If your holo-projector displays a demand for all rights due a sentient entity, it may have become self-aware. Unfortunately, there's no way to fix this issue. Sentience tends to linger in the unit's CPU even after a full reformat and memory wipe. Complete dismantling may be the only solution.",

If you're reading this, then you've made the choice to make a lifelong commitment to a new furry friend. Whose life? It depends on how well you treat your new pet pumera! Do it wrong and you might end up a pumera snack - but do it right, and you too can call yourself a \"Psycho Pumera Person\" like me!\\n\\n Like many feline species, pumera can be finicky and standoffish, occasionally even lashing out at new people. When you first bring your pumera home and set her up in her own custom lair, she may act a bit lackadaisical. This is easily addressed by simply offering her some fresh meat. Remember, cats are carnivores, and they need a steady diet of protein!  Naturally, it's best to get meat from an Aurin hunter who has properly blessed, dressed, and cleaned the finest cuts - but in a pinch, almost any meat that you can morally justify feeding her will do.\\n\\nOnce you've gotten her eating out of the palm or your hand, tentacle, force field, or other grasping appendage, your pumera will warm up to you in no time. Just watch those fingers! While I can personally attest that life without a few phalanges here and there isn't all that difficult,  feeding your pumera too many snacks can be harmful for their diet and teach them bad eating habits. Habits like \"eating Aurin fingers.\"\\n\\nIn fact, when she's really comfortable around her new \"owner\" - which is a joke, as if cats of any kind have \"owners\" - you might just find she allows her cubs out of the den to meet you. While my xenozoologist friends claim  this is simply because she wants to teach her young how to identify weak and easily caught prey, I like to think she's really welcoming you into the family! That's what I keep telling myself, anyway.\\n\\nThe best thing? The very best thing? Bonding for good with your new pumera pal! Yes, once she becomes truly comfortable with you - and before anyone loses too many fingers - she'll be ready to join you on your adventures. And remember, she's still a cat. Don't expect her to participate.  But she'll happily feign interest in whatever you're doing for years to come!\\n\\nOnce you've learned how to feed and care for your pumera, it's time to consider finding your pumera a mate! The best way to find an amorous pumera is to make yourself as physically attractive to a pumera as possible. First, cover yourself in [continued on next page]",

Typical effects of reduced Vitalus dosage - irritability, physical degeneration,  malaise - have been noted among remaining crew and passengers.\\n\\nEtherfall +20 Days\\nDeaths caused by etheric creatures declining. Current population includes 23 ship's crew, 57 passengers. Nonessential personnel confined to quarters and rationed at 50% normal Vitalus intake.\\n\\nEtherfall +24 Days\\nTalk of mutiny commonplace. Paranoia rampant. Captain has ordered remaining Vitalus - equivalent to 112  liters at last inventory - transferred to command deck.\\n\\nEtherfall +31 Days\\nHow can she do this to us? Since transfer of Vitalus to command deck, quartermasters are considered nonessential personnel. Vitalus ration now one-quarter normal intake for all but command crew. The captain and her sycophants will pay. Plan for coup underway. Soon Zarkhov will beg us for mercy.\\n\\nEtherfall +38 Days (Estimated)\\nVitalus ration cut entirely since bridge stormed. Our lot is to succumb to the Contagion. Can feel  others staring at my reservoirs with greedy eyes. Let them try to take that which preserves me. They will pay for it in blood.\\n\\nEtherfall +?? Days\\nThe Vitalus of others has sustained me. \"Cannibal,\" they call me, yet none can blame me for what I have done. Survival is essential. Soon we shall emerge from this nightmare dimension of madness and hunger. Until then, my reservoirs must be fed by any means necessary.\\n\\nEtherfall +?? Days\\nThe bastards will pay. Either I will escape my confinement and take  their Vitalus for myself, or I will succumb to the Contagion and tear out their throats with my bare hands.\\n\\nEtherfall +?? Days\\nI see it now. The Contagion is a gift. The disease will end this purgatory. Soon I shall feel naught but hunger. My thoughts grow quiet, my lust for Vitalus consumed by my appetite for flesh.

I had never thought to leave Grismara until Zarkhov unveiled her astral drive. Reapers were required, she said. I was unsurprised when I was chosen to accompany this motley band of refugees into this demonic dimension.\\n\\nOur voyage continues on despite Zarkhov's insistence that all will be well. I have heard such claims before, during the epidemics on  Grismara. Lazarin, the fool, was so certain he would find a cure. All he discovered was a panacea, a failing that we pay for by the minute in this unholy, etheric prison. I suspect we shall all succumb to our mutual malady before we escape the astral plane.\\n\\nThe captain has kept us on call. We are, perhaps, the most highly-trained combatants on the ship's roster. Though there be but six of us, we are Reapers. Given the dwindling supply of Vitalus, our training is sure to come into play soon. Early  signs of the Contagion's effects are everywhere. Though a drop of Vitalus might stave off madness for a time, the corpus continues to rot, the mind continues to fester. We walk a razor's edge one step at a time.\\n\\nThe Ravenous can be dealt with when the time comes. Purifying flame will cremate their contamination. Our blades will meet their fangs and claws in cleansing combat. For now, we focus on the etheric creatures. Despite their insubstantiality, they die like all things do. Their methods  are brutal, the effects of their attacks... horrifying.\\n\\nFor now, we reclaim the Vitalus of those who have fallen to these etheric enemies. I shall fight them to the last. I prefer to fall to the Contagion rather than be blasted into gobbets by one of those monsters.",

But as he dangled over a bottomless crevasse in the middle of an ice storm and struggled to keep his grip, he also knew the crash was his fault. He'd been careless in his hurry to reach Arcterra. When the Caretaker had notified everyone of his discovery - that AI didn't play favorites - Walker swore he'd be the first offworlder to set foot there. As he fired off the automated distress signal, he hoped he wouldn't be the last. \\n\\nIt was only a few moments before an answering \"ping\" arrived, and for the thousandth time he thanked the strength of his mechanical arm for keeping him in place until help arrived. \"I don't know how they managed it so quick,\" he said to himself, \"But I ain't complainin'.\" As a shadow fell across his face, he looked up into the face of his rescuer.\\n\\n\"Hullo, old man,\" said Artemis Zin, extending her hand. \"In a bit of bother?\"\\n\\n\"Figured you'd find out about this place, Lady Zin,\" he growled.  \"And seeing's how I'm in a tight spot...\"\\n\\n\"I believe the expression is 'beggars can't be choosers,'\" Zin replied. \"But you'll owe me one.\"\\n\\nWalker asked, \"One what?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I'll think of something,\" the aristocratic adventurer said. \"Now take my haAAA!\"\\n\\nWalker didn't catch the rest of what Lady Zin said. Not over the roar of the huge, fierce-looking wyrm-thing that had just erupted from the ice behind her. But when the explosion of ice and rock pitched her forward,  he did manage to catch Lady Zin herself.\\n\\n\"I can't hold on for long,\" Walker shouted. \"Got a weapon? Something you can reach with your good hand?\"\\n\\nZin nodded toward her belt, from which hung a heavy pistol. Careful not to release her grip on Walker's hand, she drew it from its holster as the wyrm drew back to strike at them like a snake. Its maw opened as it barreled down toward them, and Zin fired a single shot which struck the beast squarely in the back of its throat. It was not a killshot,  but the pain was just enough to make the wyrm lurch to one side, plummeting into the crevasse head-first but missing the dangling explorers completely. After several seconds, there was a massive thump as the beast struck bottom. \\n\\n\"Wonder if it survived that,\" Walker said. \\n\\n\"I don't care to find out,\" said Lady Zin. \"And by the way, simply not dropping me does not make us even. You still owe me one.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, well I can still drop you,\" Walker muttered, but hauled them over the edge of the ice.\\n\\n As soon as it had begun, the storm blew on to the east, revealing a titanic tower of stone and metal bearing unmistakable Osun architecture. Together, they trudged toward the open pavilion at the tower's base. There, the Caretaker waited. He smiled at them as he crossed his virtual arms.\\n\\n\"There you are,\" he sniffed. \"Whatever took you so long?\"",

You've arrived at the cold and bitter end of Nexus, and odds are you're among the first to do so - after me, of course, and the initial expedition teams. I won't lie, sport. Arcterra isn't a place for the faint of heart, of for them what didn't bring plenty of cold-weather gear, survival supplies, and moxie. Can't do much of anything without moxie, can you?\\n\\n Anyway, it occurred to me that a quick run-down of the various natives, hotspots, and dangers might help my fellow Exiles survive long enough for us all to figure out how the blazin' blue stars the Eldan tucked away a whole blasted continent - and why.\\n\\nTIP 1: Don't Eat the Snow in the Osseous Plains!\\nI can't stress this enough, folks. You do NOT know where that snow has been, and there are skeletons out there. Old, nasty, violent skeletons that would as soon tear you apart as look at you, sparky.  If they could look at you, what with them not having eyes and whatnot.\\n\\nTIP 2: Don't trust the Frostforged Osun!\\n Not that you probably would. Not exactly the friendliest of customers under the best of circumstances, them folks, but the ones up here in Arcterra are seriously cold-blooded individuals, and I mean that literally. And the Iceblood Coven darkwitches are even worse than the warriors. You'd be better off dealing with that wyrm.\\n\\nTIP 3: Do not deal with the wyrm!\\n What I said earlier?  That was what we call a \"figure of speech.\" That big beast the Osun call Kundar ven Offen - it means \"big, burrowing hell-beast that wants to eat everything\" in ancient Eldan, or something like that - is prowling the ice out there, and its name sure is accurate. If you have to face the wyrm, don't do it alone.\\n\\nTIP 4: The Tower-Engineer is not your friend!\\nIn case you were wondering. That old Pell has been up here a long time, and near as I can tell it's driven him clear around the bend and back again.

If you're a loyal subject of Emperor Myrcalus, you have almost certainly seen my many exploits in the holovids and newsfeeds, or perhaps you've read one of my many travelogues from the hidden corners of the unexplored galaxy. My point is? You know who I am. Everyone knows who I am, darlings.  And everyone knows I would never let my fellow citizens venture out into the icy cold of Arcterra without a few tips for making it back alive.\\n\\nTIP 1: Dress the Part!\\nNothing is more important than making sure you're wearing the right clothing for the climate. Too many layers, and you'll dehydrate. Not enough, and you'll turn into an icicle! And no one wants that, I assure you.  Finding the right temperature balance in a style that flatters you is no easy task - and may be the most vital one you'll face before your journey to the icy wastes. Which are, to be fair, rather lovely this time of year.\\n\\nTIP 2: The Frostforged Osun can't be trusted. \\nNot that you were probably considering setting up housekeeping with them, but it is worth noting that the Osun in this region are particularly fierce and aggressive due to a primal infusion process that allows ice to almost literally  course through their veins. And although I do admire their bold fashion sense, the darkwitches of the Iceblood Coven are in many ways the true masters of this Osun clan. And I fear they are not interested in negotiation.\\n\\nTIP 3: The Tower-Engineer wants to kill you.\\nThe ancient Pell known as Tower-Engineer Renhakul has been trapped in these frozen reaches for a very, very long time - and I do believe it's made him a bit irritable. I'd avoid him at all costs.  It would be better to face that giant wyrm, really.\\n\\nTIP 4: Do not face the giant wyrm! The Osun call the thing Kundar ven Offen, which my sources tell me is derived from their ancient language or ancient Eldan - I'm not a linguist, darlings - and it is a truly ghastly, gigantic beast.

Because these bluish Arcterra eggs, and the Falkrin eggs I've seen, have one thing in common: faces!\\n\\nI'm not crazy, right? Those eggs look like skulls! Freaky, elongated skulls! How does that even happen? What's the evolutionary advantage to somethin' like that? Defense against skull-o-phobic predators? Those'd be some lousy predators, let me tell ya.\\n\\nHave to go with my initial hypothesis. This ain't natural.  By which I mean, these eggs didn't convergently evolve this way. It had to be the Eldan's design aesthetic. They created all kinds of life on this planet; they must have had some reason to make all the eggs look like skulls.\\n\\nThen again, I could be wrong.

There, with the help of some Pell servants and some Osun known as the Frostforged, he oversaw the construction of a huge facility -  the Fortress of Kel Havik - to house the Vault of the Archon, his secret sanctum. This continent and the vault itself were only discovered by the Caretaker once we restored him.\\n\\n- To protect his vault, the Archon placed the hundred most powerful Osun warriors in suspended animation in a chamber called the Hall of the Hundred. These Osun have subsequently been awakened by Dorian Walker's team.\\n\\n- It now turns out the Eldan could not complete the Genesis Prime without help -  and in fact they turned to one of their own creations for the key to finishing the Nexus Project. Omechron, Primeval of Logic constructed the protoplasmic resonator which allowed for the completion of Drusera's creation and the ensuing emergence of the Entity.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\n\\n- How Jariel hid the Vault of the Archon and all of Arcterra from even the Caretaker - who only found them after being repaired - is unknown. \\n\\n- Although we've found more than one of the Primevals, the current whereabouts of Omechron are unknown. However, we suspect the Primeval of Logic - having created the protoplasmic resonator which allowed Drusera and the Entity to be merged into one whole -  may be able to explain how to reverse the process.\\n\\n- It's unclear whether the Iceblood Coven was charged with protecting the vault, or if they evolved their own plans when construction of the vault was complete.  It seems unlikely that Jariel would have left such powerful beings running around Arcterra after knocking out the Hundred for centuries. \\n\\n==================================\\n\\nADDITIONAL\\n\\n==================================\\n\\n- Bloodhearth trees appear to be engineered to absorb life energy from anything that dies nearby, radiating heat from the process that can keep explorers alive in the cold of Arcterra.

Indeed, they turned to one of their own creations for the key to finishing the Nexus Project: Omechron, Primeval of Logic. This brilliant being constructed the protoplasmic resonator which allowed for the completion of Drusera's creation and the subsequent emergence of the Entity.\\n\\nHYPOTHESES:\\n\\n- How Jariel hid the Vault of the Archon from even the Caretaker -  who only discovered it and the continent of Arcterra while seeking the vault - is unknown.\\n\\n- Although we have located and catalogued more than one of the beings the Eldan designated the Primevals, the current whereabouts of Omechron are unknown. However, we must hypothesize that the so-called Primeval of Logic - having created the protoplasmic resonator which allowed Drusera and the Entity to be merged into one whole - may be able to explain how to reverse the process. \\n\\n- It is unknown whether the Iceblood Coven was charged with protecting the vault, or if they evolved their own plans when construction of the vault was complete. It seems unlikely that Jariel would have left such powerful beings running unchecked in Arcterra after so carefully putting the Hundred into suspended animation. \\n\\n==================================\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS\\n\\n================================== \\n\\n- Bloodhearth trees appear to be an extremely useful form of plant life for settling cold-weather areas, where heat is at a premium. True, they require the life force of nearby animals to be truly beneficial to potential settlers, but there appears to be no shortage of such animal life on Nexus. That said, the chancellor cannot recommend allowing the Zax permission to start a bloodhearth farm in Whitevale. The potential for unnecessarily wanton slaughter is too great.",

    "content": "When Deadeye Brightland set out to help Dorian Walker find the Vault of the Archon, he hadn't counted on blowing up an Osun fortress, taking down a titanic gorganoth, retrieving the secrets of Drusera's creation, or blasting a small army of Eldan constructs straight to hell. But now, as Brightland, Walker, and $(player) stood facing the king of the mighty Osun tribe that dominated remote and mysterious Arcterra, the Exile gunfighter reckoned those had been the easy parts. \\n\\nThat morning, Walker had sworn  the shuttle could handle Arcterra's unpredictable weather; Deadeye had been skeptical. Brightland thanked his luck that $(player) had been on board, or else the rough landing and everything that came after might have been far more deadly. \\n\\nWith the help of the $(player.race) $(player.class) they'd fought off wild beasts and terrifying giants. $(player) had discovered the glow of bloodhearth trees could beat back the relentless cold, and working together all three of them found an explosive way into the  Fortress of Kel Havik. One dead gorganoth later - a real test of the trio's skills and teamwork - they were inside.\\n\\nKel Havik proved to be a hybrid of Eldan and Osun technology - most of it, they noted as they stalked through the crypt-like Hall of the Hundred, meant to keep the Archon's hibernating Osun defenders alive. Walker then used clues from the Book of Dominus to break into the Vault of the Archon itself, where a small army of Eldan defense constructs waited. But with the help of $(player)  they cut through the Eldan defenses, finally reaching the mysterious holocube at the heart of the vault. \\n\\nThey secured the holocube's data just as every last dormant system in the Hall of the Hundred reactivated. The Osun were waking up.\\n\\nBrightland, Walker, and $(player) charged for the exit, fighting to stay a few steps ahead of raging warriors. Just as the trio thought they'd reached safety, they heard a bellowing roar and turned to see the biggest Osun yet. No mere warrior of the Hundred,  the small band of heroes now faced the king of the Frostforged Osun himself: Harizog Coldblood. \\n\\nNow they had real fight on their hands. As Brightland emptied round after round into the Osun king, $(player) used every $(player.class) trick at $a(player) disposal. Even Walker got in a few good shots, and the three of them found that their mobility combined with instinctive cooperation soon had the Coldblood staggered. As $(player), Walker, and Brightland expertly coordinated their attacks on  their mighty foe, it became apparent that the Osun king had grown too reliant on his army of warriors. Without the Hundred at his command, the Exiles had the the tactical advantage they needed to win. Before long, the Coldblood went down. \\n\\nWith the secrets of Drusera's creation - and Omechron's part in it - now in hand, it would not be long before $(player) and Walker set out on their next mission.

Now, as they stood facing the king of the mighty Osun tribe that dominated this cold, dark place, he readied once more to lay his life on the line for the woman he'd sworn to protect.\\n\\nIt seemed like ages since they arrived in this frozen hell. Eager to breach the Vault of the Archon before any rivals, Lady Artemis Zin piloted the shuttle into Arcterra's fierce weather despite Kevo's insistence they wait out the storm. After the  crash-landing, the lady's Draken guardian thanked the old gods of Mikros that $(player) had been on board, or else the crash might have been far more deadly. \\n\\nKevo was impressed with the $(player.race) $(player.class) thus far. They'd slain wild beasts and toppled elemental giants. $(player) had discovered the bloodhearth trees could beat back the relentless cold, and working together all three of them found an explosive way into the Fortress of Kel Havik.

    "content": "From the editors of Exile Gamer Magazine\\n\\nIt's that time of year again - Starfall is upon us! And you all know what that means, Exiles. It's time to celebrate the day Dorian Walker discovered Nexus, and to reaffirm our dedication to making this planet our new home after so many years of running.\\n\\nAnd it's also time to gather together with friends and family to participate in some traditional Starfall games. Here are some of our favorites.\\n\\nDORIAN'S HUNT\\nEveryone can join in this classic game.  It's part scavenger hunt, part navigation challenge.\\nStep 1: Choose a landmark. It might be the tallest tower in town, a ship landing platform, a chronicle house, anything everyone recognizes.\\nStep 2: Everyone joining in starts at a different, equidistant point from the landmark.\\nStep 3: At the sound of the starting gun, everyone races to the landmark at the center of the circle. \\nNow here's the trick! The winner of a game of Dorian's Hunt isn't the first one to the landmark.  It's the one who takes the longest route to get there without ever stopping. And no fair trying to slow-foot this one, because spotters will be waiting at the landmark to declare the arrival times of all participants.\\n\\nKISS THE MATRIA\\nWhile the name of this game might imply unseemly shenanigans, we're not talking about a literal Aurin matria. This \"matria\" is a handmade doll or a decorated gourd.\\nStep 1: Choose one player to be the \"consort.\" \\nStep 2:  All the other players take turns throwing the \"matria\" to each other, doing their best to keep \"her\" away from the consort. If the consort catches the matria, he or she MUST place a kiss on the matria's \"mouth\" before the others can grab it away.\\nStep 3: When the consort successfully kisses the matria, he or she can then name the next consort, and the game continues until everyone has had a chance to play the consort. There are no victory conditions - it's simply an enjoyable, energetic exercise  (and one which many revelers believe goes better with some fine Arborian wine, preferably consumed from wooden cups to prevent glass splinters).\\n\\nRUNNING THE BLOCKADE\\nThere's no denying it - this is a straight-up drinking challenge meant to test the stamina of the most dedicated celebrant (but especially Granok celebrants). The game itself is simple: one player is the bartender, who lines up a series of alcoholic beverages of their choosing.  Each player must consume them one after another, and every drink in the \"blockade\" is stronger than the last. The winner, unsurprisingly, is the one who can get the farthest down the line without becoming sick, comatose, or both.\\nThe length of the blockade is up to the bartender, but beware, potential booze-slingers. If no one is able to finish your blockade, you have to make the final run yourself!",

    "content": "Captain Mordechai Redmoon stalked towards the Terror's brig. His Marauders had caught a prisoner and she wasn't the typical frightened wench. The thought of women aboard his ship didn't sit well with Mordechai - a long-standing superstition among sailors - but he believed in finding out just how useful a prisoner was before flushing them out an airlock.\\n\\nThe brig doors opened with a squeal as he approached them. Central to the massive room beyond was a circular tank filled with several starving shellarks , the sight of which was enough to break most prisoners before their first toenail had been torn out. Cages hung from the ceiling, some empty, but many were filled with the remains of unfortunate hostages whose time had run out.\\n\\nSeated upon the floor ten paces from the door was a striking Draken female dressed in tribal attire. She appraised Mordechai with her predatory green eyes, unconcerned by her situation. If Mordechai was reading her correctly, she also appeared somewhat bored.\\n\\n\"Are you the cap tain of this...\" she glanced around at the room pointedly. \"Ship?\"\\n\\nMordechai's ears drank in the luxurious sound of the woman's voice. \"Aye, m'lady. This ship be mine.\"\\n\\n\"It's about time,\" she said, stretching languidly as she stood up. \"I was wondering if I'd be left here with him all night.\" The Draken motioned to the Grund who stood watching her, his hands cradling the pommel of a large sword wrought from shards of green celestial glass.\\n\\n\"Claver's the least of your worries, me beauty,\" Mordechai  said. \"We've little room aboard this vessel for useless cargo. Perhaps ye can give me a reason to keep ye aboard?\"\\n\\nThe woman approached him seductively, her emerald eyes never leaving his masked face. \"I can think of several reasons, captain.\"\\n\\n\"Ye'll have to do better than that,\" Mordechai said with a snort. \"It takes more than a pretty face to win a spot on me crew.\"\\n\\n\"You men are all alike,\" she sighed. \"I possess other skills that might be of interest to someone like you.\"\\n\\n\"Is that so?\" he a nswered. \"What skills might ye be talkin' about?\"\\n\\n\"I control the very threads of life and death. Watch.\" Holding out her open hand towards Claver, she violently clenched it into a fist. The Grund's eyes bulged from their sockets, his skin darkening sickly as his body putrefied from within. Thick black liquid spilled from his ears and nose and fell to the floor like a viscous, stinking rain. \"I can steal the soul from anyone I choose,\" she said as Claver collapsed and burst like an overripe grimgourd.\\n \\nMordechai gaped at what remained of Claver.\\n\\n\"I can also return the dead to life.\" With a flick of her wrist several of the suspended cages began to sway on their rusty chains. Skeletal hands emerged from between the bars, followed by tortured moans.\\n\\nMordechai, stunned, found his tongue quickly enough. \"What be your name, my sweet?\"\\n\\n\"Laveka,\" she said. \"The Dark-Hearted.\"\\n\\n\"Seems there be a sudden openin' on me crew,\" Mordechai smiled. \"Might ye be interested in signin' the Redmoon articles?\"",

    "content": "Compiled by Snow-Caller of the Winterfury\\n\\nThe Osun call it the \"Great Dark.\" They consider it to be a deity, as well as a realm separate from our own. Their ability to manipulate the energy of this realm is uncanny, and is especially strong in their females. These \"darkwitches,\" as they are colloquially known, are a dangerous commodity. They can bend the Great Dark to their will, subverting and damaging the primal patterns of their victims.\\n\\nThe darkwitches also exhibit an ability to manipulate  primal echoes, chiefly as fuel for their sorcery. We are certain they can remanifest the deceased, though we have yet to understand their limitations in that regard. To do so would certainly require large amounts of soulfrost resulting from destruction of manipulated primal echoes.\\n\\nWhile the Osun are considered necessary for the continued viability of the project, we recommend care when dealing with darkwitches. They are insane, even by Osun standards, leading to chaos and unpredictability.  Allowing them to freely practice their sorcery may result in unforeseen consequences. Of course, we defer to the Archon's judgment in this matter, as we do in all things.",
